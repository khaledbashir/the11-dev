# üî• DEMO FIXES - COMPLETE (30 Minutes Deadline)

## ‚úÖ Fix 1: Portal Chat - DEPLOYED
**Problem:** Portal chat using broken OpenRouter API (401 errors)
**Solution:** Direct AnythingLLM workspace API integration
**Implementation:**
- Portal connects to `-client` workspace (e.g., `qwerty-client`)
- Same proven architecture as dashboard
- SOW embedded in workspace with assistant prompt
- Simple, clean API calls - no complex embed scripts

**Code:**
```typescript
// Portal chat sends to:
await fetch(
  `${ANYTHINGLLM_API_URL}/api/v1/workspace/${workspaceSlug}-client/chat`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message, mode: 'chat' }),
  }
);
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED - Auto-rebuild triggered via Easypanel webhook

## üü° Fix 2: Excel Export Mandatory Roles
**Problem:** AI not generating mandatory roles, causing export failures
**Solution:** Updated prompt with SCREAMING warnings and validation checklist

**Prompt Changes (`/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`):**
```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY ROLE ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL (ABSOLUTE - EXPORT WILL FAIL WITHOUT THESE) ‚ö†Ô∏è ###
üö® CRITICAL: YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE REJECTED IF THESE 3 ROLES ARE MISSING! üö®

REQUIRED ROLES (MUST APPEAR EXACTLY AS WRITTEN):
- "Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management"
- "Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination"
- "Account Management - Senior Account Manager"

‚ö†Ô∏è VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - BEFORE YOU RESPOND:
1. Have you included "Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management"? YES / NO
2. Have you included "Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination"? YES / NO
3. Have you included "Account Management - Senior Account Manager"? YES / NO

ALL THREE MUST BE "YES" BEFORE YOU SEND YOUR RESPONSE!
```

**Validation:**
- Server-side validation in `/api/sow/[id]/export-excel` route
- Checks for EXACT role names (case-sensitive)
- Returns 400 error with "MANDATORY_ROLE_MISSING" if any missing

**Status:** üü° DEPLOYED - Waiting for next SOW generation to test
