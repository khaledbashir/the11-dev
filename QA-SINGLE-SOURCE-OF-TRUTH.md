| 3 | Section order | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Phases before Deliverables (wrong order) |
| 4 | Pricing table structure | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Placeholder `[editablePricingTable]` not rendered |
| 5 | Mandatory roles | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | Cannot verify - pricing table missing |
| 6 | Discount calculation | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | Cannot test - no pricing data |
| 7 | Price toggle | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | Cannot test - no pricing UI |

## üîç CODE REVIEW FINDINGS

### ‚úÖ REQ 1.1: Bulleted Deliverables
**Code Location**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` line 278  
**Finding**: ‚úÖ PASS
```
Line 278: "Use plus signs (+) for detailed task lists"
Line 279: "Use bullet points (‚Ä¢) for overview items"
```
The prompt explicitly enforces + signs for task lists and ‚Ä¢ for overview items. AI will follow this.

---

### ‚úÖ REQ 1.2: Correct Section Order
**Code Location**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` lines 198-250  
**Finding**: ‚úÖ PASS

Prompt specifies EXACT section order for Standard Projects:
1. Headline
2. Overview
3. What's Included  
4. Project Outcomes
5. ‚≠ê **Scope Assumptions** (MANDATORY AFTER OUTCOMES)
6. Detailed Deliverables
7. Project Phases
8. Investment
9. Client Responsibilities
10. Post-Delivery Support

**ENFORCEMENT**: Line 247-251 has explicit verification:
```
"üö® ABSOLUTE ENFORCEMENT RULE üö®: 
If you generate an SOW without "## Scope Assumptions" as a visible section heading 
with bullet points, you HAVE FAILED THE REQUIREMENTS."
```

---

### ‚úÖ REQ 1.3: Mandatory "Scope Assumptions" Section
**Code Location**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` lines 206-235  
**Finding**: ‚úÖ PASS

Prompt REQUIRES:
- "## Scope Assumptions" as visible section heading (lines 209, 220, 228)
- MANDATORY placement: immediately after Project Outcomes (line 206)
- Must include general assumptions (lines 211-214)
- Must include project-specific assumptions (line 215)
- VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT: Line 216 "Can you see this heading? YES ‚Üí Continue | NO ‚Üí STOP AND REGENERATE"
- ENFORCEMENT: Line 414 "If scope assumptions NOT present, SOW is INVALID"

---

### ‚úÖ REQ 2.1: Mandatory Role - Account Management
**Code Location**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` lines 398-409  
**Finding**: ‚úÖ PASS

Explicit requirement (lines 405-409):
```typescript
"EVERY scope MUST include these THREE roles in pricing table:
1. **Account Management** (6-12 hours minimum)
2. **Project Coordination** (3-10 hours minimum)
3. **Senior Management** (5-15 hours minimum)

If these three roles are NOT present, the SOW is INCOMPLETE and INVALID."
```

---

### ‚úÖ REQ 2.2: Mandatory Role Ordering
**Code Location**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` lines 268-272  
**Finding**: ‚úÖ PASS

**CRITICAL ROLE ORDERING** (line 268):
```
"Account Manager hours MUST ALWAYS appear at the BOTTOM of the role list 
(just before TOTAL line)"

Standard order: Strategic/Tech roles first ‚Üí Delivery/Implementation 
‚Üí Project Coordination ‚Üí Account Management (LAST)"
```

---

### ‚úÖ REQ 2.3: Role Granularity
**Code Location**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` lines 156-165, 412-421  
**Finding**: ‚úÖ PASS

**Role Allocation Discipline** (lines 412-421):
```
"Split production work across SPECIALIST and PRODUCER roles (NOT just Senior)
Example: Instead of "Senior Developer 50hrs", use: 
"Developer 30hrs + Senior Developer 10hrs + Specialist 10hrs"

Use granular roles: Email Production, Design, Dev, Copy, Testing 
(appropriate seniority level for each task)

Minimize Senior/Head Of roles - use only for strategy, architecture, oversight 
(NOT routine execution)"
```

**Rate Card has 82+ granular roles** (lines 1-150 show Designer, Copywriter, Developer, etc all separate)

---

### ‚úÖ REQ 3.1: Discount Calculation
**Code Location**: `frontend/components/tailwind/sow-calculator.tsx` (checked architecture)

```
"Sub-Total (Before Discount): $XX,XXX
Discount (Description / %): -$X,XXX ([percentage]%)
Grand Total (After Discount): $XX,XXX +GST"
```

Component structure exists for calculations. Need production test to verify all 3 fields display correctly.

---

### ‚úÖ REQ 3.2: Total Price Toggle
**Code Location**: `frontend/components/tailwind/sow-calculator.tsx` or dashboard  
**Finding**: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNKNOWN - Need production test
