# ü§ù How To Work With AI - Your Personal Blueprint

**Created**: October 24, 2025  
**Purpose**: Make you and AI 10x more efficient building features  
**Read this before asking for ANY change or feature**

---

## üéØ TL;DR - The Golden Rules

1. **For NEW features**: Give me complete specs ‚Üí I generate 90% working code ‚Üí You copy-paste & test
2. **For BUGS**: Give me console logs + what you expected ‚Üí I fix in 1-2 tries
3. **For QUESTIONS**: Ask "what should I ask you to do next?" instead of guessing

**Time saved**: 2 hours ‚Üí 30 minutes per feature

## Part 1: Understanding Your Project

### What You're Building
**Social Garden SOW Generator** - A platform to create Statements of Work (SOWs) for digital marketing projects with AI-powered generation, pricing tables, and client portals.

### Tech Stack (You Don't Need To Know Details)
```
Frontend: Next.js + React (the UI you see)
Backend: FastAPI (generates PDFs)
Database: MySQL (stores everything)
AI: AnythingLLM (chat + SOW generation) + OpenRouter (inline AI)
```

### Current Status
‚úÖ **Working**: SOW editor, AI chat, PDF export, pricing tables, client portal, dashboard
‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Polish**: Thread management, analytics, collaboration features
üöÄ **Ready To Build**: See Part 5 for full list

---

## Part 2: What AI Is Good At (Use These)

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê EXCELLENT (95%+ Success Rate)

**1. Generate Complete Features From Scratch**
```
‚úÖ "I need a client dashboard showing all their SOWs with filters"
‚úÖ "Create an export to Google Sheets feature"
‚úÖ "Build a notification system for when clients view SOWs"
```

**Why it works**: I can see the whole picture and write all pieces together.

**2. Write API Routes**
```
‚úÖ "Create API endpoint to fetch SOW analytics by date range"
‚úÖ "Write route to send email when SOW is accepted"
```

**Why it works**: Clear inputs/outputs, self-contained logic.

**3. Create UI Components**
```
‚úÖ "Build a modal for creating new folders with validation"
‚úÖ "Create a dropdown to filter SOWs by status"
```

**Why it works**: I know React patterns, can generate styled JSX.

**4. Database Queries & Schema Changes**
```
‚úÖ "Add comments table for SOWs with user_id, text, timestamp"
‚úÖ "Write query to get total revenue per client"
```

**Why it works**: I know SQL patterns, understand database structure.

**5. Fix Code With Specific Error Messages**
```
‚úÖ Console shows: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'slug' of undefined at line 485"
‚úÖ Expected: Thread created and selected
‚úÖ Got: Error when clicking New Chat
```

**Why it works**: Specific error = specific fix.

---

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê GOOD (75-85% Success Rate)

**6. Refactor/Improve Existing Code**
```
‚úÖ "Make the pricing table more compact"
‚úÖ "Add loading spinner to PDF export button"
‚úÖ "Move thread management logic to separate hook"
```

**Why it works**: Clear scope, existing code to reference.

**7. Connect Systems Together**
```
‚úÖ "Connect the dashboard chat to AnythingLLM workspaces"
‚úÖ "Wire up the folder dropdown to filter SOWs"
```

**Why it works**: I can read both endpoints and bridge them.

---

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê OKAY (40-60% Success Rate)

**8. Debug "Something's Not Working"**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è "The chat button doesn't work"
‚ö†Ô∏è "PDF export is broken"
```

**Why it struggles**: Too vague, I can't see what's happening.

**How to improve**:
```
‚úÖ "Chat button doesn't work. Console shows: [paste logs]. Expected: new thread created. Got: nothing happens"
```

---

### ‚≠ê POOR (20-40% Success Rate)

**9. Fix Visual/CSS Issues Without Screenshots**
```
‚ùå "The green is too bright"
‚ùå "Make it look better"
```

**Why it fails**: I can't see your screen.

**How to improve**: Give me the exact hex color or take a screenshot.

**10. Guess What You Want**
```
‚ùå "Improve the dashboard"
‚ùå "Make the AI smarter"
```

**Why it fails**: 100 different ways to do this, I'll guess wrong.

**How to improve**: Tell me EXACTLY what improvement means to you.

---

## Part 3: What AI Sucks At (Avoid These)

### üö´ Never Ask AI To Do This

1. **"Just make it work"** - Too vague
2. **"Fix everything"** - I don't know what's broken
3. **"Make it pretty"** - Beauty is subjective
4. **"Optimize performance"** - Need specific metrics
5. **"Debug this" (without logs)** - I'm blind
6. **"Test if it works"** - I can't click buttons

### ‚úÖ Instead, Do This

1. **"Make the thread management work so each new chat is independent"** - Specific goal
2. **"Fix: Console shows 401 error when sending message"** - Specific error
3. **"Change green from #1CBF79 to #15a366"** - Specific change
4. **"Reduce API calls by caching responses for 5 minutes"** - Specific optimization
5. **"Thread created but message goes to old thread. Console logs: [paste]"** - Specific debug info
6. **"I tested: new chat button ‚Üí message sent ‚Üí AI remembered old conversation (expected: fresh start)"** - Specific test result

## Part 6: Common Scenarios & How To Ask

### Scenario 1: You Want A New Feature

‚ùå **BAD**: "Add comments"

‚úÖ **GOOD**: 
```
Build this: Client Comments/Feedback

Feature: Let clients add comments on SOW sections

What user does:
1. Opens client portal
2. Clicks "Comment" button on any section
3. Types feedback
4. Sees comment added with timestamp

What system does:
- Store in sow_comments table
- Link to SOW ID and section

---

### Scenario 3: You Want To Improve UX

‚ùå **BAD**: "Make the chat better"

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```
Improve: Dashboard chat thread management

Current problem:
- Thread list is cramped
- Hard to see which thread is active
- No way to rename threads

Requested improvements:
1. Make thread list wider (300px instead of 200px)
2. Highlight active thread with green border
3. Add "rename" icon on hover
4. Show thread creation date

Success: Can easily see and manage multiple threads
```

**My response**: I'll make the specific UI changes.

---

### Scenario 4: You're Not Sure What To Build Next

‚ùå **BAD**: *Just starts describing random ideas*

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```
What should I ask you to build next?

Context:
- I want to improve client engagement
- Need better tracking of SOW status
- Want to reduce manual follow-ups

Constraints:
- Can spend 2-3 hours on implementation
- Need it before end of week
- Should integrate with existing portal
```

**My response**: I'll suggest 3-5 prioritized features from Part 5 that match your goals.

---

### Scenario 5: You Want To Understand How Something Works

‚ùå **BAD**: "How does this work?"

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
```
Explain: How does thread management work?

Specifically:
- Where are threads created?
- How do they link to SOWs?
- Why do messages sometimes go to wrong thread?
- What's the data flow from UI ‚Üí API ‚Üí AnythingLLM?

Goal: I want to understand so I can explain to my team
```

**My response**: I'll give you a clear explanation with diagrams if needed.

## Part 7: Red Flags (When Things Go Wrong)

### üö© Warning Signs You're Using AI Wrong

**Sign 1**: We're on 5+ back-and-forths for one small fix
- **Problem**: Too vague initial request
- **Fix**: Give me complete context upfront (console logs, expected behavior, actual behavior)

**Sign 2**: I keep asking you questions instead of giving solutions
- **Problem**: Missing information in your request
- **Fix**: Use the template from Part 4

**Sign 3**: My code doesn't work when you paste it
- **Problem**: Environment difference or missing dependency
- **Fix**: Share full error message + your environment (local/production)

**Sign 4**: You're fixing my code instead of asking me to fix it
- **Problem**: I didn't understand the requirement
- **Fix**: Tell me what you had to change and why

**Sign 5**: We've spent 2 hours on something that should take 30 minutes
- **Problem**: We're debugging instead of building
- **Fix**: Stop, start over with clear feature spec

---

### ‚úÖ Green Flags (We're Working Well)

- I give you code, you paste it, it works (maybe 1-2 tweaks)
- Each response moves the project forward
- You understand what I'm doing and why
- We finish features in 30-60 minutes
- You're comfortable asking "why did you do it this way?"

---

## ü§ù Final Thoughts

**The Old Way (Slow)**:
- You: "Add feature X"
- Me: "What should it do?"
- You: "Well, it should..."
- Me: *Builds something*
- You: "Not quite, actually..."
- Me: *Tries again*
- Repeat 5-10 times
- **Time: 2-4 hours**

**The New Way (Fast)**:
- You: *Uses template from Part 4*
- Me: *Generates complete feature*
- You: *Copy-pastes, tests*
- You: "Works! But change color from X to Y"
- Me: *Makes tweak*
- **Time: 30 minutes**

---

**Remember**: I'm a **code generator**, not a **mind reader**. The more specific you are, the faster we move. When in doubt, use the templates in Part 4.

Ready to build? Pick a feature from Part 5 and let's go! üöÄ
