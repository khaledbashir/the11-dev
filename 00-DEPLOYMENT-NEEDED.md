## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Easypanel Auto-Deploy
If you have GitHub webhook configured in Easypanel:
1. Easypanel should auto-detect the push
2. Trigger rebuild manually if needed from Easypanel dashboard

### Option 2: Manual Rebuild
```bash
# SSH into your VPS
cd /root/the11-dev
git pull origin enterprise-grade-ux
# Trigger your deployment script
```

### Option 3: Check Easypanel Logs
- Go to Easypanel dashboard
- Check if build is in progress
- Check build logs for errors

---

## What Will Work After Deployment

1. **Favicon** ‚úÖ - Will show your new dark logo
2. **Logo** ‚úÖ - Brand color matches #0E0F0F
3. **Excel Export** ‚úÖ - Won't fail on role validation
4. **Inline Editor Logs** ‚úÖ - Will see detailed console output showing:
   - Text selection detection
   - `/ai` slash command triggering
   - Event listener status

---

## Current Issues (Will Be Fixed After Deploy)

### Excel Export Error:
```
"Tech - Head Of- Senior Project Management" (missing space)
"Account Management - (Senior Account Manager)" (has parentheses)
```

**Root Cause**: AI is generating slightly wrong role names

**Fix Needed After Deploy**: 
Update The Architect prompt to be EVEN MORE strict about exact role names

### Inline Editor Not Working:
- No selection logs appearing
- No event listeners firing
- Using old code without debugging

**Fix**: Deploy latest code with comprehensive logging

---

## Next Steps

1. üî¥ **DEPLOY NOW** - Trigger rebuild in Easypanel
2. üü° **Test After Deploy**:
   - Check favicon loads
   - Select text in editor - should see console logs
   - Type `/ai` - should see event logs
   - Try Excel export with correct role names
3. üü¢ **If Still Issues** - Share new console logs and we'll debug further
