## Follow-Up Questions (Be Ready)

### Q: "Can I change the rate card?"
**A:** "Yes. It's in `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`. Edit the THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT constant. The AI will use the new rates immediately."

### Q: "Can I add more roles?"
**A:** "Yes. Just add them to the rate card in the system prompt. Format: `- Role Name: $XXX/hr`"

### Q: "What about those 3 partial items?"
**A:** "They work via the editor now. If you want dedicated UI buttons, I can add them. Should take 1-2 hours each."

### Q: "Can clients see this Requirements page?"
**A:** "It's at `/portal/requirements` - you can share the link. Or we can make a simplified client-facing version without the technical details."

### Q: "How do I update the system prompt?"
**A:** "Edit `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` ‚Üí update THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT ‚Üí restart the server. Changes apply immediately."

---

## Troubleshooting

### If AI doesn't show pricing table:
- Make sure you're in a SOW-type workspace (not generic)
- Check that the workspace has THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT applied
- Try: "Generate a pricing table for [service] with [roles]"

### If PDF export fails:
- Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Check env var: `echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_PDF_SERVICE_URL`
- Check browser console for errors

### If Requirements page doesn't load:
- Check URL: Must be `/portal/requirements` (no trailing slash)
- Check frontend is running: `ps aux | grep next`
- Check browser console for React errors

## Pro Tips

1. **Show the code live**: If Sam wants proof, open `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` in VS Code and search for "RATE CARD" to show the actual data.

2. **Generate a fresh SOW during demo**: Instead of showing an old one, generate a new SOW live. Ask: "Create a 4-month Salesforce implementation SOW with 3 phases" and watch it generate with correct rates.

3. **Export PDF live**: Don't use a pre-made PDF. Generate one during the demo so Sam sees the end-to-end workflow.

4. **Highlight the system prompt**: Show him THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT in the code. It's 500+ lines of detailed instructions - that's where all the magic happens.

5. **Compare to his original brief**: Have his requirements document open on another screen. Go line-by-line if needed.
