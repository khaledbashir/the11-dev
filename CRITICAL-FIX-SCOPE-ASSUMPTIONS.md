# üö® CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED - Scope Assumptions Missing

**Status**: BLOCKER  
**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Root Cause**: THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT is not generating Scope Assumptions section  
**Sam's Requirement**: MANDATORY - Req 1.3 explicitly requires this section  

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Generated SOW shows**:
```
Overview
What's Included  
Project Outcomes
Engagement Phases ‚Üê WRONG (should be Scope Assumptions here)
Detailed Deliverables
Pricing Table
```

**Should be**:
```
Overview
What's Included
Project Outcomes
**Scope Assumptions** ‚Üê MISSING IN GENERATED SOW
Detailed Deliverables
Engagement Phases
Pricing Table
```

---

## WHAT'S BROKEN

1. **Scope Assumptions section completely missing** - AI not generating it
2. **Pricing table is placeholder** `[editablePricingTable]` - not actual pricing data
3. **Engagement Phases in wrong position** - appears before deliverables instead of phases

---

## THE FIX

### Issue 1: Scope Assumptions Not Generated

**File**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`  
**Location**: THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT (lines 198-250)  
**What to check**:

The prompt SAYS it's mandatory but the AI is not following it. The issue is likely:
- The AI is treating the instruction as optional
- The verification checkpoint isn't strong enough
- The section isn't being output because of how markdown parsing works

**Action needed**:
1. Make verification checkpoint BEFORE outputting any other section
2. Add explicit output requirement: "Now output the full SOW starting with Overview and continuing through Scope Assumptions"
3. Use EXACT markers so section cannot be missed

### Issue 2: Pricing Table Placeholder

**File**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` (the prompt telling AI to generate pricing)  
**Problem**: Prompt generates `[editablePricingTable]` instead of actual pricing data

**Action needed**:
1. AI should generate actual pricing table markdown with real roles and hours
2. Table format: `| Role | Hours | Rate | Total |`
3. Must include Account Management at bottom

### Issue 3: Section Order Wrong

**File**: `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` (section ordering in prompt)  
**Problem**: AI outputs "Engagement Phases" where "Scope Assumptions" should be

**Action needed**:
1. Add explicit verification step: "Did you output Scope Assumptions after Project Outcomes? YES/NO"
2. If NO, don't proceed to next section
3. Don't output Engagement Phases until Scope Assumptions is confirmed

---

## NEXT STEP

**YOU NEED TO**:
1. Review THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT in `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`
2. Find why Scope Assumptions is not being generated
3. Fix the prompt to enforce this section and regenerate test SOW
4. Run audit again

**I'M WAITING**: For you to fix and regenerate. Once fixed, we can test all 8 requirements properly.

## WHAT THIS BLOCKS

Until Scope Assumptions + pricing table are fixed:
- Cannot verify Q2 (Scope Assumptions placement) - FAIL
- Cannot verify Q3 (Section order) - FAIL  
- Cannot verify Q4 (Pricing table structure) - FAIL
- Cannot verify Q5 (Mandatory roles) - FAIL
- Cannot verify Q6 (Discount calculation) - BLOCKED
- Cannot verify Q7 (Price toggle) - BLOCKED
- Cannot verify Q8 (PDF export) - BLOCKED

**Only Q1 passed** because deliverables ARE formatted correctly as bullets.

---

## THE EVIDENCE

**Generated SOW (markdown)** shows these sections in this order:
- Headline ‚úì
- Overview ‚úì
- What's Included ‚úì
- Project Outcomes ‚úì
- **Engagement Phases** ‚Üê WRONG POSITION
- OPTION A - Detailed Deliverable Groups
- Pricing Table: `[editablePricingTable]` ‚Üê PLACEHOLDER, NOT DATA

**Missing**: `## Scope Assumptions` section entirely

---

## REPAIR PLAN

1. **Check**: Why is prompt not generating Scope Assumptions?
2. **Fix**: Make it mandatory with enforcement
3. **Test**: Generate new SOW
4. **Verify**: Run full 8-question audit again
5. **Report**: Document results

Ready when you are!
