# ‚úÖ SOW AUTO-EMBEDDING FIX - DEPLOYED

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** üöÄ DEPLOYED & READY TO TEST  
**Git Commit:** `dd8f441`

---

## üéØ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Root Cause Discovered:** SOWs were being saved to the database but **NEVER embedded into AnythingLLM workspaces**. This meant:
- ‚ùå Client workspaces were empty (no documents for AI to read)
- ‚ùå Master dashboard had no SOW data (couldn't answer analytics questions)
- ‚ùå The AI was literally blind - no knowledge base to query

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

### 1. Automatic Embedding on SOW Save/Update
**File:** `/frontend/app/api/sow/[id]/route.ts`

Every time a SOW is saved or updated, the system now automatically:

1. **Converts** TipTap JSON ‚Üí HTML ‚Üí Plain text
2. **Embeds** using the **Dual-embed protocol**:
   - üì§ **Individual workspace** (e.g., `sow-client-abc-123`)
   - üì§ **Master dashboard** (`sow-master-dashboard-63003769`)
3. **Includes metadata**: docId, clientName, vertical, serviceLine, createdAt
4. **Non-blocking**: If embedding fails, SOW save still succeeds

### 2. Uses Correct AnythingLLM API Endpoints
**Per Tech Co-Founder Spec:**

```typescript
// Step 1: Upload raw text via /v1/document/raw-text
POST /api/v1/document/raw-text
{
  textContent: "<SOW content as text>",
  metadata: { ... }
}

// Step 2: Embed in workspace via /update-embeddings
POST /api/v1/workspace/{slug}/update-embeddings
{
  adds: ["document-location-from-step-1"]
}
```

This is the **official Dual-embed protocol** for SOW content injection.

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** Original code tried to import TipTap client-side extensions in server-side API route  
**Solution:** Use `sowContentToHTML()` utility function that's already available

**Before (broken):**
```typescript
import { generateHTML } from '@tiptap/html';
import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document';
// ... 10 more client-side imports ...
const html = generateHTML(content, [Document, Paragraph, ...]);
```

**After (working):**
```typescript
const { sowContentToHTML } = await import('@/lib/export-utils');
const html = sowContentToHTML(content);
```

## üìä WHAT'S NEXT

### Step 1: Test Auto-Embedding with New SOW
1. Go to https://sow.qandu.me
2. Create or update any SOW
3. Save it
4. Check backend logs for:
   ```
   üìö [SOW xxx] Embedding SOW in workspace: ...
   ‚úÖ [SOW xxx] Successfully embedded in workspace: ...
   ‚úÖ [SOW xxx] Also embedded in master dashboard for analytics
   ```

### Step 2: Verify in AnythingLLM UI
1. Go to: https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host
2. Navigate to the SOW's workspace
3. Click "Documents" tab
4. **Should see:** The SOW document listed

### Step 3: Backfill Existing SOWs
All old SOWs need to be embedded manually (one-time):

```bash
cd /root/the11-dev/frontend
npx tsx scripts/backfill-sow-embeddings.ts
```

This will:
- Query all existing SOWs from database
- Convert each to HTML
- Embed in both individual workspace + master dashboard
- Show progress with ‚úÖ/‚ùå status for each

### Step 4: Test Dashboard Analytics
1. Go to https://sow.qandu.me/dashboard
2. Ask the AI: **"how many clients do we have?"**
3. **Expected:** Real answer based on embedded SOWs (not fake error message)
4. **Bonus:** The `<think>` tags should be VISIBLE (shows AI's reasoning)

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [x] Code deployed to production
- [ ] Test auto-embedding with new SOW
- [ ] Verify documents appear in AnythingLLM workspace
- [ ] Run backfill script for existing SOWs
- [ ] Test dashboard analytics query
- [ ] Confirm `<think>` tags visible in dashboard
- [ ] Check logs for any errors

---

## üö® DOCKER MOUNT QUESTION - ANSWERED

**Q:** "Could the Docker mounts issue be related?"  
**A:** ‚úÖ **NO** - AnythingLLM container HAS persistent storage:

```bash
$ docker inspect ahmad_anything-llm
"Mounts": [{
  "Type": "volume",
  "Name": "ahmad_anything-llm_storage",
  "Source": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/ahmad_anything-llm_storage/_data",
  "Destination": "/app/server/storage",
  "RW": true
}]
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ AnythingLLM documents **WILL PERSIST** across restarts
- ‚úÖ Not a volume mount issue
- ‚úÖ The real problem was SOWs were never being embedded in the first place

---

## üìù FILES MODIFIED

1. `/frontend/app/api/sow/[id]/route.ts` - Added automatic embedding logic
2. `/frontend/lib/anythingllm.ts` - Already had `embedSOWDocument()` method (perfect!)
3. `/frontend/lib/export-utils.ts` - Already had `sowContentToHTML()` (reused it!)
4. `/frontend/scripts/backfill-sow-embeddings.ts` - New backfill script

---

## üéâ EXPECTED OUTCOME

**Before this fix:**
- Dashboard AI: "I don't have access to specific client data..." (fake error)
- AnythingLLM workspaces: Empty / No documents
- New SOWs: Saved to DB but never embedded

**After this fix:**
- Dashboard AI: Answers analytics questions with real data
- AnythingLLM workspaces: Contains embedded SOW documents
- New SOWs: Automatically embedded on every save
- `<think>` tags: Visible in dashboard (shows reasoning)

---

**Ready to test!** üöÄ

Try creating/updating a SOW and then check the AnythingLLM workspace to confirm the document appears.
