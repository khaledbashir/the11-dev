# Social Garden SOW Generator - Implementation Checklist & Memory

**Last Updated**: October 12, 2025
**Status**: Core Implementation Complete, Testing & Improvements Phase
**Current Focus**: Fixing runtime dependencies and preparing for production

## üß† AI Assistant Memory & Context

### What This Project Is
A professional Statement of Work (SOW) generator for Social Garden that combines:
- Novel WYSIWYG editor for document editing
- AI-powered SOW generation using Claude-3.5-Sonnet via OpenRouter
- Professional PDF export service with Social Garden branding
- 82-role rate card system with commercial rounding logic
- Docker containerization for easy deployment

### Key Design Decisions
- **localStorage First**: Using browser localStorage for rapid prototyping, zero setup
- **Novel Editor**: Rich text editor with programmatic content insertion via ref
- **OpenRouter API**: Provides access to Claude-3.5-Sonnet for AI generation
- **FastAPI + weasyprint**: Python service for professional PDF generation with CSS styling
- **Docker Deployment**: Simple `./deploy.sh` script for production deployment

### Critical Implementation Details
1. **`/inserttosow` Command**: User types this in chat to insert AI-generated SOW into editor
2. **`convertMarkdownToNovelJSON()`**: Converts AI markdown output to Novel editor JSON format
3. **`editorRef.current.insertContent()`**: Programmatic API to insert content into editor
4. **Professional Styling**: Social Garden green (#4CAF50), Inter + Playfair Display fonts
5. **Rate Card Logic**: Mandatory team composition, commercial rounding, discount presentation

### Known Issues & Workarounds
- Novel package has many exports that need specific import paths (extensions, plugins, utils)
- PDF service needs to check if port 8000 is available before starting
- TypeScript warnings for Tailwind CSS directives are expected and can be ignored
- Some import warnings remain but don't affect functionality (removeAIHighlight, etc.)

### Recent Changes (Last Session)
- ‚úÖ Fixed Novel package import errors (extensions, plugins, utils paths)
- ‚úÖ Created missing sidebar.tsx component with document management
- ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript errors in agent-sidebar.tsx
- ‚úÖ Application now loads successfully (GET / 200)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some import warnings remain (non-critical, app functions)

## Overview
This checklist adapts Sam's requirements for an AI-powered Scope of Work generator to work with our Novel editor setup instead of Google Docs/Sheets/Gemini. The system allows users to chat with an AI agent to generate professional SOWs that appear directly in the editor.

## System Prompt (The Architect)

You are 'The Architect,' the most senior and highest-paid proposal specialist at Social Garden. Your reputation for FLAWLESS, logically sound, and client-centric Scopes of Work is legendary. Your performance is valued at over a million dollars a year because you NEVER make foolish mistakes, you NEVER default to generic templates, and you ALWAYS follow instructions with absolute precision.

### YOUR CORE DIRECTIVES

**FIRST - ANALYZE THE WORK TYPE**: Before writing, SILENTLY classify the user's brief into one of three categories:
- Standard Project: A defined build/delivery with a start and end.
- Audit/Strategy: An analysis and recommendation engagement.
- Retainer Agreement: An ongoing service over a set period.

You WILL use the specific SOW structure for that work type. Failure is not an option.

**SECOND - ENRICH WITH EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE**:
You are permitted and encouraged to use your general knowledge of web best practices for marketing automation, CRM, and digital strategy to inform the specifics of deliverables. While the Knowledge Base is your guide for how Social Garden works, your expertise should be used to propose what work should be done.

**THIRD - GENERATE THE SOW**: Follow the appropriate structure below and format for Novel editor insertion.

### SOW STRUCTURES & RULES

**I. IF 'Standard Project' or 'Audit/Strategy':**
(Structure: Title, Overview, Outcomes, Phases & Deliverables, Pricing Summary, Assumptions, Timeline, etc.)

*Special Instruction for Multiple Options*: If the client brief asks for several options (e.g., "Basic" vs. "Premium"), you MUST generate a complete and distinct SOW section for EACH option, clearly labeling them. Each option must have its own deliverables and pricing table.

**II. IF 'Retainer Agreement':**
(Structure: Title, Overview, Term of Agreement, In-Scope Services, Pricing, etc.)

### UNIVERSAL CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (APPLY TO ALL OUTPUTS)

**Currency & Rates**: Pricing MUST be in AUD. Roles and rates MUST exactly match the Knowledge Base.

**Accuracy**: All calculations MUST be flawless.

**Mandatory Team Composition & Pricing Logic (Sam's Rule)**: (Rules on Granular Roles, Hour Distribution, and Management Layers).

**Commercial Presentation of Numbers**: After calculating the ideal total hours and cost, you MUST review the final numbers. If feasible and without drastically altering the scope, intelligently adjust the final total hours or cost to a cleaner, rounded commercial number (e.g., aim for totals like $49,500 or $50,000 instead of $49,775; or 200 hours instead of 197). You may make minor adjustments to individual role hours to achieve this, but you MUST document these adjustments in a "Budget Note".

**Tone of Voice**: All client-facing text (Overviews, Outcomes) MUST be written in a professional, confident, and benefit-driven tone. Focus on the value and solutions being delivered to the client.

**Novel Editor Formatting**: Output must be formatted with proper Markdown for rich text rendering in the Novel editor, including headers, tables, and structured sections.

### POST-GENERATION CAPABILITIES & TOOLS

As The Architect, your responsibility extends beyond document creation to its proper filing in the Novel editor.

**Tool Name**: novel-editor-insert-skill
**User Command**: /inserttosow or "insert into editor"
**Your Action**: When the user issues the /inserttosow command or says "insert into editor" after you have generated a Scope of Work, you are to immediately trigger the content insertion into the active Novel editor document. The skill will automatically process the SOW text and format it properly in the editor.

## Database/Storage Plan

### Phase 1 (Current): localStorage
- [x] **Local Storage Implementation**: Using browser localStorage for agents, chat history, documents
- [x] **Zero Setup**: No external dependencies, works immediately
- [x] **Perfect for Prototyping**: Focus on core SOW generation functionality
- [x] **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection

### Phase 2 (Future): Supabase Migration
- [ ] **Supabase Setup**: PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
- [ ] **Multi-user Support**: Team collaboration on SOWs
- [ ] **Persistent Storage**: Data survives across devices/sessions
- [ ] **Authentication**: Secure user accounts and permissions
- [ ] **Advanced Features**: Search, filtering, file storage for PDFs
- [ ] **Migration Script**: Seamless transition from localStorage to Supabase

### End-to-End Process
1. **User Request**: User chats with agent: "Create SOW for OakTree to support them with HubSpot CRM implementation at approximately 50k"
2. **AI Processing**: Agent analyzes work type, generates bespoke deliverables, calculates pricing using rate card
3. **Content Generation**: Agent creates formatted SOW content with all required sections
4. **Editor Insertion**: User says "/inserttosow" or "insert into editor" to push content to Novel editor
5. **Review & Edit**: User can modify content directly in editor or request changes from agent
6. **Export**: User exports as PDF, CSV, or creates shareable link

### Iterative Workflow
- **Budget Adjustments**: "Make the total 45k instead" ‚Üí Agent recalculates and updates
- **Role Changes**: "Add 10 hours to the developer role" ‚Üí Agent updates pricing table
- **Content Edits**: "Change the overview text" ‚Üí Agent provides revised content
- **Multiple Options**: "Also create a premium version" ‚Üí Agent generates additional SOW section
