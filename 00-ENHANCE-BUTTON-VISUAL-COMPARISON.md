## 💬 AI BEHAVIOR

### ❌ BEFORE: Showing Thinking & Asking Questions

**User Input:**
```
how many clients do I have and who's my top paying client
```

**AI Output:**
```
<think>
The user is asking about their client count and who their top paying 
client is. This seems like a database query that would require access 
to their business data. I need to clarify what systems they use to 
track this information and help them structure the approach to find 
this data.
</think>

I'll help you identify your client count and top-paying client. To 
provide accurate information, I need to understand your data setup:

**Data Source Questions:**
1. **Where is your client data stored?** (CRM like Salesforce/HubSpot, 
   billing system like QuickBooks/Stripe, spreadsheet, database, etc.)

2. **What defines a "client"?**
   - Active paying customers only?
   - All accounts (including dormant/suspended)?
   - Individual users vs. company accounts?

3. **Payment Data Location:**
   - Revenue tracking system (billing software, Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
   - What time period should I analyze? (monthly, quarterly, annual?)

What's your primary system for managing clients and payments?
```

### ✅ AFTER: Direct Enhancement, No Questions

**User Input:**
```
how many clients do I have and who's my top paying client
```

**AI Output:**
```
Query the customer database to identify: 1) Total count of active 
clients in the system (exclude dormant/cancelled accounts), 2) Revenue 
analysis by client to determine the highest-paying account based on 
total lifetime value including both one-time purchases and recurring 
revenue over the past 12 months, 3) Generate a summary report showing 
total active client count, top 5 clients ranked by revenue with specific 
dollar amounts, percentage of total revenue represented by the top 
client, and client retention metrics for the top tier accounts.
```

## 🎯 SOW GENERATION EXAMPLE

### ❌ BEFORE: Conversational & Questions

**User Input:**
```
HubSpot integration and 3 landing pages, 26k budget
```

**AI Output:**
```
<think>
The user is asking for a project brief for HubSpot integration and 3 
landing pages with a budget of $26k. This seems to be a continuation 
of our earlier conversation about HubSpot integration and landing pages, 
but with different parameters (3 pages instead of 4, and higher budget 
of $26k instead of 16k). I should create a comprehensive project brief 
for this updated scope.
</think>

Create a comprehensive project brief for a HubSpot integration and 
landing page development project with these specifications:

**Project Overview:**
Develop a complete HubSpot CRM integration system and create 3 
conversion-optimized landing pages, with a total budget allocation 
of $26,000.

...

What industry/business type, target audience, and specific HubSpot 
features are you looking to prioritize in this integration?
```

### ✅ AFTER: Clean Enhancement, No Questions

**User Input:**
```
HubSpot integration and 3 landing pages, 26k budget
```

**AI Output:**
```
Create a comprehensive Statement of Work for HubSpot CRM integration 
and development of 3 conversion-optimized landing pages with a firm 
budget of $26,000 AUD. Include: Phase 1 - HubSpot CRM setup with 
contact management, deal pipelines, lead scoring, and email automation 
workflows. Phase 2 - Design and development of 3 responsive landing 
pages with form integration, conversion tracking, A/B testing capability, 
and analytics setup. Phase 3 - Data migration, testing, optimization, 
and knowledge transfer sessions. Break down pricing by specific roles 
from the Social Garden rate card (Tech - Head Of - Senior Project 
Management, Tech - Producer - Design, Tech - Producer - Development, 
Tech - Specialist - Campaign Orchestration, Tech - Integrations - 
Integration Specialist, Account Management - Account Manager) with 
hours allocated per phase. Ensure budget adherence through discount 
calculation if necessary to hit exactly $26,000.
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Code Consistency

**Before:** Different implementations
```typescript
// DashboardSidebar.tsx
if (enhanced && enhanced.trim()) {
  setChatInput(enhanced.trim());
  toast.success('Prompt enhanced');
} else {
  toast.error('No enhancement generated');
}

// WorkspaceSidebar.tsx  
if (!enhanced || !enhanced.trim()) {
  toast.error('Enhancer returned empty text');
  return;
}
setChatInput(enhanced.trim());
toast.success('Prompt enhanced');
```

**After:** Identical implementations
```typescript
// Both files now use the same logic
if (!enhanced || !enhanced.trim()) {
  toast.error('Enhancer returned empty text');
  return;
}
setChatInput(enhanced.trim());
toast.success('Prompt enhanced');
```

## 🎨 UI Components Match

### Button Props Comparison

**Before:**
```tsx
// DashboardSidebar
<Button
  className="self-end bg-[#0E2E33] hover:bg-[#143e45] text-white border border-[#1CBF79]"
  title="Enhance your prompt with AI"
>
  {enhancing ? (
    <Loader2 className="h-5 w-5 animate-spin text-[#1CBF79]" />
  ) : (
    <span className="text-lg">✨</span>
  )}
</Button>

// WorkspaceSidebar
<Button
  size="sm"
  className="self-end bg-[#0E2E33] hover:bg-[#143e45] text-white h-[50px] font-semibold border border-[#1CBF79]"
  title="Enhance"
>
  {enhancing ? (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Loader2 className="h-5 w-5 animate-spin text-[#1CBF79]" />
      <span className="text-sm">Enhancing…</span>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <span className="text-lg">✨</span>
      <span className="text-sm">Enhance</span>
    </div>
  )}
</Button>
```

**After:** IDENTICAL in both files
```tsx
<Button
  size="sm"
  className="self-end bg-[#0E2E33] hover:bg-[#143e45] text-white h-[50px] font-semibold border border-[#1CBF79]"
  title="Enhance"
>
  {enhancing ? (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Loader2 className="h-5 w-5 animate-spin text-[#1CBF79]" />
      <span className="text-sm">Enhancing…</span>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <span className="text-lg">✨</span>
      <span className="text-sm">Enhance</span>
    </div>
  )}
</Button>
```

## 📊 SANITIZATION LAYERS

### Multi-Layer Defense Against Bad Output

**Layer 1: System Prompt (Primary Defense)**
```
CRITICAL RULES:
1. Do NOT use <think>, <thinking>, or any thinking tags
2. Do NOT ask questions or request clarification
3. Do NOT add conversational text
4. Do NOT suggest alternatives
5. Output ONLY the enhanced prompt text itself
```

**Layer 2: API Sanitization (Safety Net)**
```typescript
// Strip thinking tags
sanitized = sanitized.replace(/<think>[\s\S]*?<\/think>/gi, '');
sanitized = sanitized.replace(/<thinking>[\s\S]*?<\/thinking>/gi, '');

// Remove conversational prefixes
/^(here'?s|here is) (the|an?) (enhanced|improved) (prompt|version)[\s:]+/i

// Remove question blocks
/\*\*.*Questions.*:\*\*[\s\S]*$/i
```
