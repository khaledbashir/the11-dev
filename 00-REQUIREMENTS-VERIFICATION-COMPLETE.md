## Partial Requirements (3 items)

These 3 items are marked "partial" because they work but lack dedicated UI automation:

1. **Discount Presentation** (4.3)
   - AI can generate discount tables in content
   - Manual editing in TipTap works
   - No dedicated discount UI component yet

2. **Toggle Total Price** (4.6)
   - Users can manually edit/remove totals in editor
   - No toggle button UI component yet

3. **CSV Export** (4.7)
   - Tables can be copied/pasted from editor
   - No automated CSV export button yet

**Note:** All 3 features are *functional* via the editor - they just don't have dedicated UI buttons. Users can accomplish all tasks manually.
