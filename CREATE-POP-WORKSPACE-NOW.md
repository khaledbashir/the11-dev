## ‚úÖ That's It!

Now your editor AI will:
- ‚ú® Respond to "Ask AI" commands
- üöÄ Stream responses in real-time
- ‚úèÔ∏è Help with text transformations
- üéØ Work separately from sidebar chat

---

## Test It

1. Open your app at `localhost:3000`
2. Create or open a document
3. Select some text
4. Click "Ask AI" button (or use `/` command)
5. Type: `make this more professional`
6. Watch AI transform your text!

---

## Why This Matters

**Sidebar Chat AI** (Gardner workspaces):
- Full SOW generation
- Multi-turn conversations
- Complex document creation

**Editor "Ask AI"** (`pop` workspace):
- Quick text fixes
- Grammar corrections
- Expand/shorten text
- Inline editing

**Two different AIs for two different jobs!** üéØ

---

## Troubleshooting

**If "Ask AI" doesn't work:**
1. Check workspace slug is EXACTLY `pop` (lowercase, no spaces)
2. Verify workspace has an AI model configured
3. Check console for errors
4. Restart dev server if needed

**Still not working?**
Check environment variable:
```bash
echo $ANYTHINGLLM_WORKSPACE_SLUG
# Should output: pop
```

---

## üöÄ Ready to Go!

Everything is coded and configured. Just create the workspace and you're done!
