# ✅ WHAT I NEED FROM YOU - BEFORE BUILDING DIRECT SHEETS

Before I start implementation, I need you to provide **3-5 key pieces of information**.

---

## 1️⃣ GOOGLE CLOUD SETUP

**Do you already have a Google Cloud project?**

### Option A: "Yes, I have one set up"
If yes, I need:
- [ ] Google Cloud Project ID
- [ ] Service Account JSON key file (or I can guide you to create one)
- [ ] Google Sheets API enabled in your project
- [ ] Service account has "Editor" role

### Option B: "No, I don't have one / Not sure"
If no, I can:
- [ ] Create a Google Cloud project for you (with your account)
- [ ] Enable Google Sheets API
- [ ] Create a service account
- [ ] Generate the JSON key
- **Time needed:** 15-20 minutes (one-time setup)

**Your answer:** A or B?

---

## 2️⃣ GOOGLE DRIVE FOLDER

**Where should the generated sheets be saved?**

### Option A: "Root of my Google Drive"
- Sheets appear at top level
- Anyone with link can access
- Simple to find

### Option B: "Specific folder in Google Drive"
- If yes, what's the folder name?
- Example: "Social Garden SOW Sheets" or "Client Deliverables"
- I'll create if doesn't exist

### Option C: "Shared drive"
- If you have a Google Workspace with Shared Drives
- Provide the Shared Drive name/ID

**Your answer:** Which option? And folder name if B?

---

## 3️⃣ SHEET PERMISSIONS

**Who should be able to see the generated sheets?**

### Option A: "Only the creator (user who generated it)"
- User alone has link
- Private to that person

### Option B: "Share with specific email"
- If yes, what email(s)?
- Example: client@example.com or team@socialgarden.co
- I can auto-share created sheets

### Option C: "Public link (anyone with link)"
- Anyone who has the link can view
- Good for client sharing

**Your answer:** Which option?

---

## 4️⃣ SHEET NAMING CONVENTION

**How should generated sheets be named?**

### Example Options:
- `SOW - [Client Name] - [Service] - Oct 2025`
- `[Client] - [Project] - Statement of Work`
- `SG SOW - [Date]`
- Custom format?

**Show me a sample name:**
```
Example: SOW - Acme Corp - Email Marketing - Oct 2025
```

---

## 5️⃣ BRANDING CUSTOMIZATION

**For the sheet header, what text should appear?**

Currently planned:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [GREEN HEADER]                             │
│ SOCIAL GARDEN                              │
│                                            │
│ CLIENT: [client name]                      │
│ SERVICE: [service]                         │
│ PROJECT: [project name]                    │
│ DATE: [date]                               │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Customizations:
- [ ] Keep "SOCIAL GARDEN" at top? (yes/no)
- [ ] Add logo or specific brand element? (if you have a Google Drive public image URL)
- [ ] Change header color from green (#1CBF79)? (what color?)
- [ ] Add any footer text? (copyright, terms, etc.)

**Your answers:**

---

## 6️⃣ OPTIONAL: AUTO-SHARING SETTINGS

**Should the sheet be automatically shared after creation?**

### Option A: "Don't auto-share"
- User gets link
- They manually share with client

### Option B: "Auto-share with specific users"
- List emails
- System auto-shares with "Viewer" permission
- Example: ["client@example.com", "manager@socialgarden.co"]

### Option C: "Auto-share with domain"
- If you have @socialgarden.co domain
- All domain users get access

**Your answer:** A, B, or C?

## MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS (Fastest Path)

**If you just want me to build it ASAP with sensible defaults:**

Just tell me:

1. **"Use Google Cloud setup A or B?"**
   - If B: I create everything for you (15 min)

2. **"Should sheets auto-share? (yes/no, and with whom?)"**
   - If no: User gets link, they share manually
   - If yes: Email addresses to auto-share to

3. **"Folder location?"**
   - Root or specific folder name?

That's literally it. I can fill in the rest with good defaults.

---

## EXAMPLE: MINIMUM ANSWERS NEEDED

```
Q1: Do you have a Google Cloud project?
A: "No, set it up for me"

Q2: Auto-share the sheets?
A: "Yes, share with client@example.com"

Q3: Where to save?
A: "In a folder called 'Social Garden SOW Sheets'"
```

**That's all I need to start!**

---

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU ANSWER

1. **I create** backend service with your settings
2. **I create** frontend button component
3. **I create** API endpoint to handle sheet creation
4. **I test** the entire flow
5. **I deploy** to production
6. **Done** - One-click sheet generation live

**Timeline once I have your answers:**
- Implementation: 10-14 hours
- Testing: 1-2 hours
- Deploy: 30 minutes
- **Total: Ready by end of this week or early next week**

## MY RECOMMENDATION (Defaults I'd Use)

If you say "just use sensible defaults":

```
✅ Google Cloud: I'll set up a new project
✅ Folder: Root of Google Drive
✅ Permissions: Auto-share with creator only
✅ Naming: SOW - [Client] - [Service] - [Date]
✅ Branding: Keep green header, no custom color/logo
✅ Auto-share: No (user shares manually)
```
