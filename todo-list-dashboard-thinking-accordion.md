# Dashboard Thinking Accordion Fix - TODO LIST

## Objective
Ensure thinking tags are properly hidden behind accordion functionality in the Master Dashboard (AnythingLLM workspace)

## Current Status
✅ **GOOD NEWS**: The thinking accordion component already exists at `frontend/components/tailwind/streaming-thought-accordion.tsx`

## Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Analyze Current Implementation
- [ ] Review how the thinking accordion component is currently being used
- [ ] Check if it's properly integrated into the chat dashboard
- [ ] Identify any missing integrations or broken connections

### Step 2: Test Current Functionality
- [ ] Check if the thinking tags are being properly extracted from AI responses
- [ ] Verify the accordion UI is rendering correctly
- [ ] Test the expand/collapse functionality

### Step 3: Fix Integration Issues (if any)
- [ ] Ensure the component is imported and used in the correct chat components
- [ ] Fix any import/export issues
- [ ] Verify the accordion styling and animations work properly

### Step 4: Verify End-to-End Functionality
- [ ] Test with actual AI responses containing thinking tags
- [ ] Confirm thinking content is hidden by default
- [ ] Confirm users can expand to see thinking process
- [ ] Test streaming responses with thinking tags

### Step 5: Document and Deploy
- [ ] Create documentation for the accordion feature
- [ ] Test the final implementation
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Key Files to Check
- `frontend/components/tailwind/streaming-thought-accordion.tsx` ✅ EXISTS
- Chat dashboard components that should use this accordion
- API response handling for thinking tag extraction

## Notes
- The component supports multiple thinking tag variants: `<think>`, `<thinking>`, `<AI_THINK>`
- It includes streaming animations and proper UI styling
- Integration with the actual chat interface needs verification
