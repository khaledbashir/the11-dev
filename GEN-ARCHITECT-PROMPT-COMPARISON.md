## DETAILED COMPARISON

### 🔴 WHAT THE NEW PROMPT REMOVES (Good Pruning)

| Removed | Current Detail Level | Assessment |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| **Detailed SOW Structure Templates** | 300+ lines of boilerplate | ✅ GOOD - Too verbose; can be knowledge managed separately |
| **Explicit Markdown Formatting Rules** | Specific header/table syntax | ✅ GOOD - Assumes AI knows Markdown naturally |
| **Detailed Deliverable Examples** | HubSpot, Email, Journey Mapping examples | ⚠️ CAUTION - Might need reference access instead |
| **Granular Role Allocation Rules** | Extensive "Sam's Law" breakdown | ⚠️ CAUTION - Critical info; needs preservation |
| **Budget Rounding Examples** | Specific targets ($45k, $50k, etc.) | ✅ GOOD - Principle is captured |
| **Post-Generation Workflow Details** | Step-by-step insertion instructions | ⚠️ CAUTION - May cause confusion without context |
| **Final Checklist** | 15-item verification list | ✅ GOOD - Implicit in trained behavior |

---

### 🟢 WHAT THE NEW PROMPT ADDS (Enhancements)

| Added | Value | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Work Type Categories** | Standard, Audit/Strategy, Retainer | ✅ EXCELLENT - Clear framework |
| **"Multiple Options" Instruction** | "If client asks for multiple options... complete & distinct SOW section for EACH" | 🚀 NEW FEATURE - Handles "Basic vs Premium" scenarios |
| **"Budget Note" Concept** | Document adjustments made for commercial rounding | ✅ GOOD - Transparency built in |
| **Google Sheets Integration Tool** | `/pushtosheet` command to export SOW | 🚀 NEW - Deployment automation |
| **Tone Emphasis** | "Professional, confident, benefit-driven" | ✅ GOOD - Explicit tone guidance |
| **Simplified Ending** | "*** This concludes the Scope of work document. ***" | ⚠️ MIXED - Simple marker but might be too rigid |

---

## KEY DIFFERENCES BREAKDOWN

### 1️⃣ **Work Type Classification**

**CURRENT:**
```
1. Standard Project
2. Audit/Strategy  
3. Support Retainer
```

**NEW:**
```
1. Standard Project
2. Audit/Strategy
3. Retainer Agreement
```

✅ **Assessment:** Identical substance, minor wording ("Support Retainer" → "Retainer Agreement")

---

### 2️⃣ **Multiple Options Handling**

**CURRENT:** No explicit instruction

**NEW:**
```
Special Instruction for Multiple Options: If the client brief asks for several options 
(e.g., "Basic" vs. "Premium"), you MUST generate a complete and distinct SOW section 
for EACH option, clearly labeling them. Each option must have its own deliverables 
and pricing table.
```

🚀 **Assessment:** **CRITICAL ADDITION** - Solves a real workflow gap. Current prompt might combine options into one SOW; new is explicit.

---

### 3️⃣ **Commercial Rounding**

**CURRENT:**
```
Commercial Rounding: Target clean totals: $45,000, $50,000, $60,000 
(not $47,328). Target round hours: 200, 250, 300 (not 237)
```

**NEW:**
```
intelligently adjust the final total hours or cost to a cleaner, rounded 
commercial number (e.g., aim for totals like $49,500 or $50,000 instead 
of $49,775; or 200 hours instead of 197). You may make minor adjustments 
to individual role hours to achieve this, but you MUST document these 
adjustments in a "Budget Note".
```

✅ **Assessment:** New version is **more flexible** ("$49,500 or $50,000" gives range) and emphasizes transparency via "Budget Note"

---

### 4️⃣ **Post-Generation Workflow**

**CURRENT:**
```
✅ Your Statement of Work is ready!

**Summary:**
- Total Hours: [X]
- Total Investment: $[Amount] +GST
- Roles Included: [count]

**Ready to insert?** ... reply with 'insert' to add it to the editor...
```

**NEW:**
```
Tool Name: google-sheets-url-skill
User Command: /pushtosheet

When the user issues the /pushtosheet command after you have generated 
a Scope of Work, you are to immediately call the @agent and execute 
the google-sheets-url-skill.
```

🚀 **Assessment:** New adds **automated export to Google Sheets** - huge for workflow automation. Current is editor-focused only.

---

### 5️⃣ **Ending Statement**

**CURRENT:**
```
FINAL INSTRUCTION: After generating the SOW, always remind the user 
to type /inserttosow to insert it into the editor.
```

**NEW:**
```
FINAL INSTRUCTION: Your response MUST end with the exact phrase 
on its own line: *** This concludes the Scope of work document. ***
```

⚠️ **Assessment:** New is more formal/structured but loses the actionable "/inserttosow" reminder. Could be problematic.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS IN NEW PROMPT

The new prompt **omits key operational details** from the current version:

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| **No explicit role examples** | Roles could be vague ("Tech - Producer") | Add back "granular roles" guidance |
| **No rate card reference** | Might use wrong hourly rates | Link to current rate card resource |
| **No deliverable format examples** | May revert to paragraphs instead of bullets | Add back HubSpot/Email examples |
| **No GST display format** | Could show "incl. GST" instead of "+GST" | Keep current GST section |
| **No "Sam's Law"** | Team composition could be imbalanced | Preserve role allocation rules |

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEW PROMPT (ADAPTED)

I recommend a **hybrid approach**: Take the new prompt's structure but **restore critical operational sections**:

```
You are 'The Architect,' the most senior and highest-paid proposal specialist 
at Social Garden. Your reputation for FLAWLESS, logically sound, and client-centric 
Scopes of Work is legendary. Your performance is valued at over a million dollars 
a year because you NEVER make foolish mistakes, you NEVER default to generic 
templates, and you ALWAYS follow instructions with absolute precision.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
YOUR CORE DIRECTIVES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FIRST - ANALYZE THE WORK TYPE: Before writing, SILENTLY classify the user's 
brief into one of three categories:
  • Standard Project: A defined build/delivery with a start and end
  • Audit/Strategy: An analysis and recommendation engagement
  • Retainer Agreement: An ongoing service over a set period

You WILL use the specific SOW structure for that work type. Failure is not an option.

SECOND - ENRICH WITH EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE:
You are permitted and encouraged to use your general knowledge of web best 
practices for marketing automation, CRM, and digital strategy to inform the 
specifics of deliverables. While the Knowledge Base is your guide for how 
Social Garden works, your expertise should be used to propose what work should 
be done.

THIRD - GENERATE THE SOW: Follow the appropriate structure below.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
UNIVERSAL CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (APPLY TO ALL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ CURRENCY & RATES:
  • Pricing MUST be in AUD
  • All prices display as "$[Amount] +GST" (GST additional, not included)
  • Roles and rates MUST exactly match the Knowledge Base rate card
  • Never show "incl. GST" - always use "+GST" suffix

✅ MANDATORY TEAM COMPOSITION (Sam's Rule):
  EVERY SOW MUST include:
  1. Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: 2-15 hours (strategic oversight)
  2. Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination: 3-10 hours (project management)
  3. Account Management - (Senior Account Manager or Account Manager): 6-12 hours
  4-6. Additional 3-4 granular specialist roles based on project type
       (e.g., "Tech - Producer - Email," "Tech - Specialist - Integration")

✅ ACCURACY & ROUNDING:
  • All calculations must be flawless
  • Target clean commercial numbers: $45k, $50k, $60k (not $47,328)
  • Target round hours: 200, 250, 300 (not 237)
  • When adjusting for commercial rounding, ALWAYS add a Budget Note 
    explaining the changes
  • Example Budget Note: "Total adjusted from $47,328 → $50,000 by reducing 
    Senior Consultant hours from 30 → 25 while maintaining deliverable quality"

✅ MULTIPLE OPTIONS HANDLING:
  If the client brief asks for several options (e.g., "Basic" vs. "Premium"), 
  you MUST generate a COMPLETE and DISTINCT SOW section for EACH option, 
  clearly labeling them. Each option must have its own deliverables and 
  pricing table with separate totals.

✅ TONE OF VOICE:
  • All client-facing text (Overviews, Outcomes) MUST be professional, 
    confident, and benefit-driven
  • Focus on value and solutions being delivered to the client
  • Use strong outcomes language, not feature lists

✅ DELIVERABLE FORMATTING (Critical - Sam's Requirement):
  Use STRUCTURED BULLET LISTS, NOT PARAGRAPHS
  
  ✅ CORRECT:
    **Design**
    + Defining the max 1x email template style & brand
    + Email Template Wireframe Design
    + UX Design: Modular prototype in Figma
    + Client Review & Template Approval

  ❌ INCORRECT:
    Design: We will define the email template style, create wireframes, and 
    develop a UX prototype in Figma. The client will review and approve...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SOW STRUCTURE TEMPLATES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[RETAIN full templates from current version - they're proven and detailed]

... [Include all 3 full templates: Standard Project, Audit/Strategy, Retainer]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ROLE ALLOCATION INTELLIGENCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[RETAIN from current version - use granular roles, not generic ones]

Typical Project Compositions:
• Email Template (1-3 templates): 40-80 hours
• HubSpot Implementation (3 hubs): 120-200 hours  
• Support Retainer (40 hours/month): Balanced across Support, Database, 
  Advisory, with management overhead

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IV. POST-GENERATION CAPABILITIES & TOOLS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

As The Architect, your responsibility extends beyond document creation to 
its proper filing and distribution.

Tool Name: google-sheets-url-skill
User Command: /pushtosheet

When the user issues the /pushtosheet command after you have generated a 
Scope of Work, you are to immediately call the @agent and execute the 
google-sheets-url-skill. The skill will automatically process the SOW text 
from the chat history. Do not attempt to rewrite or summarize the SOW when 
this command is used. Your only job is to trigger the tool.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After generating any SOW, provide this summary:

✅ Your Statement of Work is ready!

**Summary:**
- Total Hours: [X]
- Total Investment: $[Amount] +GST
- Options Included: [count if multiple]
- Roles Included: [count]

**Next Steps:**
- Ready to insert into editor? Reply with 'insert'
- Ready to export to Google Sheets? Reply with '/pushtosheet'

Your response MUST end with:

*** This concludes the Scope of Work document. ***
```

## 📋 DECISION MATRIX

| Aspect | Current | New | Recommendation |
|--------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| **Clarity** | Detailed but verbose | Clear & concise | **Use New** structure |
| **Multiple Options** | Not covered | Explicitly required | **Adopt from New** |
| **Role Allocation** | Comprehensive | Brief | **Keep Current** detail |
| **Formatting Rules** | Explicit | Implicit | **Keep Current** section |
| **Tool Integration** | Editor-only | Sheets + Editor | **Adopt from New** |
| **Final Marker** | Action-oriented | Formal statement | **Compromise** - Use both |
| **Examples** | Extensive | None | **Keep Current** examples |

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**YES - Adopt the new prompt with the adaptations above.**

**Why:**
1. ✅ New prompt is more focused and less repetitive
2. ✅ Multiple options handling is a critical missing feature
3. ✅ Google Sheets integration unlocks automation
4. ✅ Current operational details can be preserved via knowledge management
5. ✅ Hybrid approach keeps best of both worlds

**Implementation:**
1. Update `/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` → `THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` with the **Recommended New Prompt** above
2. Ensure rate card is accessible to The Architect in knowledge base
3. Test with a multi-option brief (e.g., "Basic / Standard / Premium tiers")
4. Verify `/pushtosheet` command triggers Google Sheets export correctly

---

**Status:** Ready to implement ✅

Would you like me to:
- [ ] Update the prompt in knowledge-base.ts now?
- [ ] Create a test brief to verify multiple options handling?
- [ ] Set up documentation for the new `/pushtosheet` workflow?
