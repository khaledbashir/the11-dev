## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Repository Management:**
- **Never push experimental code** to the production repository
- **Always test in dev repo first** before merging to production
- **Keep main branch stable** - only production-ready code
- **Use dev repo for:** new features, experiments, breaking changes

### **Branch Strategy:**
- `main` (production repo) → Stable, production-ready
- `dev/ui-and-features` (dev repo) → Active development
- Feature branches → For specific feature development

### **Backup & Recovery:**
- Production repo serves as stable backup
- Dev repo contains latest experimental work
- Regular commits to both repositories
- Use GitHub for version control and collaboration
