## 🎯 Your Action Items

### Priority 2: Trigger Backfill API (5 minutes) ⏳
- [ ] **Step 1:** Open browser console or terminal
- [ ] **Step 2:** Execute backfill:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://sow.qandu.me/api/admin/backfill-tags
  ```
  OR (from browser console):
  ```javascript
  fetch('/api/admin/backfill-tags').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
  ```
- [ ] **Step 3:** Wait for response (2-5 minutes)
- [ ] **Step 4:** Verify success:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "updated_sows": 38,
    "failed_sows": 0
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Step 5:** Verify in database:
  ```bash
  SELECT vertical, COUNT(*) FROM sows GROUP BY vertical;
  ```
- [ ] **Expected result:** Distribution across multiple verticals (not all "other")

### Priority 3: Financial Migration Script (45 minutes) ⏳
- [ ] **Step 1:** Create file `scripts/migrate-financial-data.ts`
- [ ] **Step 2:** Copy migration script template from `00-ACTION-REQUIRED-NOW.md`
- [ ] **Step 3:** Update `package.json` with new script:
  ```json
  "migrate:financial-data": "ts-node scripts/migrate-financial-data.ts"
  ```
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run migration:
  ```bash
  npm run migrate:financial-data
  ```
- [ ] **Step 5:** Verify results:
  ```bash
  SELECT SUM(total_investment) FROM sows;
  ```
- [ ] **Expected result:** $400K-500K (not $0.00)

## 📚 Documentation Review Checklist

### For Your Reference (as needed):

- [ ] Read **00-INVESTIGATION-COMPLETE.md** (Quick reference)
- [ ] Read **00-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-OCT23.md** (5-minute overview)
- [ ] Skim **00-ACTION-REQUIRED-NOW.md** (Before taking action)
- [ ] Check **INVESTIGATION-REPORT-OCT23-DASHBOARD-FAILURES.md** (If debugging)
- [ ] Use **00-DASHBOARD-INVESTIGATION-INDEX.md** (For navigation)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Checklist

### If Backfill Fails:
- [ ] Check AnythingLLM is running: `curl https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host/api/v1/workspaces`
- [ ] Verify `sow-master-dashboard` workspace exists in AnythingLLM
- [ ] Check server logs for errors
- [ ] See troubleshooting in **00-ACTION-REQUIRED-NOW.md**

### If Financial Migration Fails:
- [ ] Review pricing table structure in one SOW's content
- [ ] Customize `extractTableTotal()` function to match structure
- [ ] See troubleshooting in **00-ACTION-REQUIRED-NOW.md**

### If Dashboard Still Shows $0:
- [ ] Verify migration script ran without errors
- [ ] Check database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sows WHERE total_investment > 0;`
- [ ] If 0 rows, pricing wasn't extracted - check table structure
