# ‚úÖ Smart Discount Feature - Implementation Complete

## What Was Built

The **Smart Discount** feature automatically detects and applies discount percentages from AI-generated SOW content to the interactive pricing table, eliminating manual entry and ensuring consistency between narrative text and calculations.

---

## How It Works

### The Problem (Before)
When The Architect AI generated a discount in the SOW narrative:
```markdown
**Discount:** 21.7%
```

The pricing table would be inserted with `discount: 0`, requiring users to:
1. Read the discount from the text
2. Manually enter it into the pricing table
3. Risk inconsistency if they missed it or entered it incorrectly

### The Solution (After)
The system now **automatically**:
1. **Parses** the discount from the raw AI-generated text using regex
2. **Extracts** the numerical value (e.g., `21.7` from "Discount: 21.7%")
3. **Applies** it to the pricing table's discount attribute
4. **Calculates** all totals with the discount pre-applied

**Result:** If The Architect says "21.7% discount", the pricing table shows 21.7% and all calculations reflect it immediately.

## Technical Implementation

### File Modified
**`/root/the11-dev/frontend/app/page.tsx`**

### Changes Made

#### 1. Discount Parsing (Lines 123-135)
```typescript
const convertMarkdownToNovelJSON = (markdown: string, suggestedRoles: any[] = [], options: ConvertOptions = {}) => {
  const lines = markdown.split('\n');
  const content: any[] = [];
  let i = 0;
  let pricingTableInserted = false;
  const strictRoles = !!options.strictRoles;
  
  // üéØ SMART DISCOUNT FEATURE: Parse discount from the raw text
  let parsedDiscount = 0;
  const discountMatch = markdown.match(/\*\*Discount[:\s]*\*\*\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*%/i) || 
                        markdown.match(/Discount[:\s]*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*%/i);
  if (discountMatch && discountMatch[1]) {
    parsedDiscount = parseFloat(discountMatch[1]);
    console.log(`üéØ Smart Discount detected: ${parsedDiscount}%`);
  }
```

**What it does:**
- Searches the raw markdown for discount patterns
- Supports both bold (`**Discount:**`) and plain text (`Discount:`)
- Extracts decimal values (e.g., `21.7`, `15`, `10.5`)
- Defaults to `0` if no discount found
- Logs detection to console for debugging

**Regex patterns matched:**
- `**Discount:** 21.7%`
- `**Discount: ** 21.7%`
- `Discount: 21.7%`
- `**Discount** 21.7%`
- `Discount 21.7%`
- Case-insensitive (`discount:`, `DISCOUNT:`, etc.)

#### 2. Pricing Table Creation (Line 342)
```typescript
console.log('‚úÖ Inserting EditablePricingTable with', pricingRows.length, 'roles.');
content.push({
  type: 'editablePricingTable',
  attrs: {
    rows: pricingRows,
    discount: parsedDiscount, // üéØ Smart Discount: Use parsed discount from AI content
  },
});
```

**What changed:**
- **Before:** `discount: 0` (hardcoded zero)
- **After:** `discount: parsedDiscount` (uses parsed value from AI content)

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Discount Format
**AI generates:**
```markdown
# Scope of Work - ABC Corporation

**Client:** ABC Corporation
**Discount:** 21.7%

## Deliverables
- Website redesign
- SEO optimization
```

**Result:**
- Pricing table inserted with `discount: 21.7`
- All calculations automatically show 21.7% discount applied
- Total investment reflects discounted price

### Example 2: Plain Text Format
**AI generates:**
```markdown
Based on the client's bulk purchase agreement, we're applying a 
Discount: 15% to the total project cost.
```

**Result:**
- Pricing table inserted with `discount: 15`
- Works even without bold formatting

### Example 3: No Discount
**AI generates:**
```markdown
# Scope of Work - XYZ Ltd

**Client:** XYZ Ltd

## Deliverables
- Mobile app development
```

**Result:**
- No discount line found
- Pricing table inserted with `discount: 0` (default)
- No discount applied to calculations

### Example 4: Decimal Precision
**AI generates:**
```markdown
**Discount:** 12.75%
```

**Result:**
- Pricing table inserted with `discount: 12.75`
- Supports decimal precision for accurate calculations

## How The Architect Should Format Discounts

### ‚úÖ Recommended Format (Most Reliable)
```markdown
**Discount:** 21.7%
```

**Why:** Bold formatting + colon + space is the most explicit and readable format.

### ‚úÖ Alternative Formats (Also Supported)
```markdown
**Discount: ** 21.7%
Discount: 21.7%
**Discount** 21.7%
Discount 21.7%
```

### ‚ùå Formats That Won't Work
```markdown
21.7% discount applied        ‚ùå (no "Discount:" keyword)
Total after 21.7% reduction   ‚ùå (wrong keyword)
- Discount of 21.7%           ‚ùå (bullet point adds complexity)
Discount = 21.7%              ‚ùå (uses = instead of :)
```

**Best practice:** The Architect prompt should be updated to consistently use:
```
**Discount:** [percentage]%
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Verify Parsing
**Steps:**
1. Ask The Architect to generate an SOW with 20% discount
2. Check browser console for: `üéØ Smart Discount detected: 20%`
3. Verify pricing table shows discount field = 20

**Expected:**
- Console log appears
- Pricing table discount field pre-filled with 20
- Calculations reflect 20% reduction

### Test 2: Verify Decimal Precision
**Steps:**
1. Generate SOW with **Discount:** 15.75%
2. Check pricing table discount field

**Expected:**
- Shows exactly `15.75` (not rounded to 16)
- Calculations use precise value

### Test 3: Verify No Discount
**Steps:**
1. Generate SOW without any discount line
2. Check pricing table discount field

**Expected:**
- Shows `0`
- No discount applied
- No errors in console

### Test 4: Verify Case Insensitivity
**Steps:**
1. Manually edit AI prompt to return `DISCOUNT: 10%`
2. Check if parsing still works

**Expected:**
- Detects `10%` correctly
- Case doesn't matter

### Test 5: Verify Multiple Discount Lines
**Steps:**
1. Generate SOW with multiple discount references
2. Check which value is used

**Expected:**
- Uses **first match** found in text
- No errors or conflicts

## Edge Cases Handled

### Edge Case 1: No Percentage Sign
**Input:** `Discount: 21.7` (missing %)

**Current behavior:** Won't match (requires %)

**Recommendation:** Keep strict - ensures AI formats correctly

### Edge Case 2: Multiple Decimals
**Input:** `Discount: 21.7.5%` (invalid number)

**Current behavior:** `parseFloat()` returns `21.7` (JavaScript behavior)

**Result:** Graceful degradation to valid number

### Edge Case 3: Negative Discount
**Input:** `Discount: -10%`

**Current behavior:** Parses as `-10`

**Result:** Pricing table component should validate (0-100 range)

**Recommendation:** Add validation in pricing table component if needed

### Edge Case 4: Discount > 100%
**Input:** `Discount: 150%`

**Current behavior:** Parses as `150`

**Result:** Would create negative total

**Recommendation:** Add validation in pricing table component (cap at 100%)

### Edge Case 5: Discount in Table Cell
**Input:**
```
| Role | Hours | Rate | Discount |
| Dev  | 10    | 100  | 20%      |
```

**Current behavior:** Won't match (requires "Discount:" pattern)

**Result:** Table discount ignored, only narrative discount parsed

**This is correct:** Discount applies to entire SOW, not per-role

## Integration with Existing Features

### ‚úÖ Works With
- Role enforcement (Head Of, Project Coordination, Account Management)
- Canonical role name mapping
- Empty role filtering
- Markdown table parsing
- Structured JSON roles
- Client-specific workspaces
- Dashboard embedding

### ‚úÖ Doesn't Interfere With
- PDF export
- SOW versioning
- Client acceptance
- Rate card lookups
- Document saving/loading

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
- **Prompt engineering:** The Architect prompt should consistently include discount line
- **UI validation:** Pricing table component should validate 0-100% range
- **User override:** Users can still manually edit discount field after insertion

---

## Console Logging

### Success Messages
```
üéØ Smart Discount detected: 21.7%
‚úÖ Inserting EditablePricingTable with 5 roles.
```

### No Discount Found
```
‚úÖ Inserting EditablePricingTable with 5 roles.
```
(No smart discount log - indicates default 0% used)

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Enhancement 1: Multiple Discount Tiers
Support role-specific or tier-specific discounts:
```markdown
**Discount:** 
- Standard roles: 15%
- Premium roles: 10%
```

**Implementation:** Would require more complex parsing and pricing table schema changes.

### Enhancement 2: Discount Reason
Parse and display discount justification:
```markdown
**Discount:** 20%
**Reason:** Bulk purchase agreement
```

**Implementation:** Add `discountReason` field to pricing table attrs.

### Enhancement 3: Discount Validation
Add range validation in parsing:
```typescript
if (discountMatch && discountMatch[1]) {
  parsedDiscount = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, parseFloat(discountMatch[1])));
  // Clamps to 0-100% range
}
```

### Enhancement 4: Discount History
Track discount changes for audit:
```typescript
attrs: {
  rows: pricingRows,
  discount: parsedDiscount,
  discountHistory: [
    { value: 21.7, source: 'AI', timestamp: Date.now() }
  ]
}
```

## Prompt Engineering Recommendations

### Update The Architect System Prompt

Add this to The Architect's instructions:
```
When applying a discount to the SOW, ALWAYS include it in this exact format:

**Discount:** [percentage]%

Examples:
- **Discount:** 21.7%
- **Discount:** 15%
- **Discount:** 10.5%

Place the discount line prominently in the executive summary or pricing section.
This ensures the interactive pricing table automatically applies the discount.
```

### Example Architect Response
```markdown
# Scope of Work - Australian Gold Growers

**Client:** Australian Gold Growers
**Project:** Website Redesign & Digital Marketing
**Discount:** 21.7%

## Executive Summary
Based on the client's ongoing partnership and bulk commitment, 
we're pleased to offer a 21.7% discount on this engagement.

## Deliverables
...
```
