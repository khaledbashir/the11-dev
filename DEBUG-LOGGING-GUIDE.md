# üîç AGGRESSIVE DEBUG LOGGING DEPLOYED

## Commit Information
- **Commit:** `679e4d0`
- **Message:** `debug(api): add aggressive payload logging to stream-chat route`
- **File Modified:** `frontend/app/api/anythingllm/stream-chat/route.ts`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub

---

## What This Does

This change adds **comprehensive payload logging** to the `/stream-chat` API endpoint. Every time a request comes in, it will dump the complete request body to server-side console logs BEFORE any processing occurs.

This will expose:
1. ‚úÖ What workspace slug is being sent
2. ‚úÖ What mode is being sent (query vs chat)
3. ‚úÖ What the raw message content is
4. ‚úÖ Everything about the thread and model parameters
5. ‚úÖ Exactly what message is being sent to AnythingLLM

---

## Logging Output Format

When you trigger the logging, you'll see output like this in your server logs:

```
//////////////////////////////////////////////////
// CRITICAL DEBUG: INCOMING /stream-chat PAYLOAD //
//////////////////////////////////////////////////
FULL REQUEST BODY:
{
  "workspace": "sow-master-dashboard",
  "threadSlug": null,
  "mode": "query",
  "model": "anythingllm",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "hi"
    }
  ]
}

KEY FIELDS:
  workspace: sow-master-dashboard
  workspaceSlug: undefined
  threadSlug: null
  mode: query
  model: anythingllm
  messages.length: 2
  messages[0].role: system
  messages[0].content (first 200 chars): ...
  messages[messages.length-1].role: user
  messages[messages.length-1].content (first 200 chars): hi

//////////////////////////////////////////////////

=== WORKSPACE RESOLUTION ===
workspace param: sow-master-dashboard
workspaceSlug param: undefined
effectiveWorkspaceSlug: sow-master-dashboard

=== ABOUT TO SEND TO ANYTHINGLLM ===
Endpoint: https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host/api/v1/workspace/sow-master-dashboard/stream-chat
Mode: query
ThreadSlug: null
Message to send (first 500 chars):
[[DASHBOARD_SYSTEM_OVERRIDES]]
You are in the Master Dashboard analytics workspace. You ONLY analyze existing embedded SOW knowledge to answer business/analytics questions. Never draft or generate a new SOW, proposal, or template. Keep answers concise, numeric where possible, and reference specific SOW titles when applicable.

[[USER]]
hi

...
=== END DEBUG ===
```

## How to Trigger the Logging

### Step 1: Ensure deployment is ready
The commit is on GitHub. You'll need to deploy this to your production environment (or trigger a rebuild if using auto-deploy).

### Step 2: Test in Master Dashboard
1. Navigate to the Master Dashboard in the application
2. Type: `hi` (or any message)
3. Send the message

### Step 3: Check Server Logs
- **If running locally:** Check your terminal/console where the Next.js server is running
- **If on EasyPanel:** Go to your application ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Runtime Logs
- **If on PM2:** Run `pm2 logs sow-frontend` or `pm2 logs`

### Step 4: Look for the Debug Output
Search in the logs for:
```
CRITICAL DEBUG: INCOMING /stream-chat PAYLOAD
```

You should see the complete payload dump immediately after.

## What We're Looking For

### The Critical Question
Is the `workspace` parameter in the incoming request actually `sow-master-dashboard`?

**If YES:** Then the problem is NOT with what we're sending to AnythingLLM.  
**If NO:** Then we found the smoking gun - something else is overriding it.

### The Endpoint URL
Look at this line in the output:
```
Endpoint: https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host/api/v1/workspace/sow-master-dashboard/stream-chat
```

Is the workspace slug in the URL exactly `sow-master-dashboard`?  
**If YES:** Correct ‚úÖ  
**If NO:** Wrong workspace is being used ‚ùå

### The Message Being Sent
Look at the "Message to send" section. Does it contain:
```
[[DASHBOARD_SYSTEM_OVERRIDES]]
You are in the Master Dashboard analytics workspace. You ONLY analyze existing embedded SOW knowledge...
```

**If YES:** Correct dashboard override is being added ‚úÖ  
**If NO:** Override isn't being applied ‚ùå

---

## Interpreting the Results

### Scenario 1: Logging Proves Everything is Correct
```
workspace: sow-master-dashboard ‚úÖ
effectiveWorkspaceSlug: sow-master-dashboard ‚úÖ
Endpoint: .../workspace/sow-master-dashboard/stream-chat ‚úÖ
Message contains [[DASHBOARD_SYSTEM_OVERRIDES]] ‚úÖ
```

**Conclusion:** The API is sending the RIGHT data. The problem is in AnythingLLM itself or how its response is being handled by the client.

**Next Step:** We investigate AnythingLLM's actual response and client-side rendering.

### Scenario 2: Logging Reveals the Problem
```
workspace: gen-the-architect ‚ùå (should be sow-master-dashboard)
```

**Conclusion:** The FRONTEND is sending the wrong workspace slug. Something on the client-side is passing the wrong value.

**Next Step:** We trace the client-side code that calls this API.

---

## Expected Behavior After Logging

The logging is **temporary and aggressive**. It will:
- ‚úÖ Print to server console/logs (NOT visible to end users in UI)
- ‚úÖ Not affect performance noticeably (only console.log calls)
- ‚úÖ Not affect the actual chat response
- ‚úÖ Not break anything
- ‚úÖ Be easy to remove later (just delete the logging blocks)

---

## Next Steps After Collecting Logs

1. **Collect the logs** from your server after typing "hi" in Master Dashboard
2. **Share the output** with the debugging session
3. **Look for inconsistencies** in the workspace slug between:
   - What the frontend is sending (in the request body)
   - What we resolve as `effectiveWorkspaceSlug`
   - What endpoint URL we construct
   - What message content we build

This is the **single point of truth** - the logs cannot lie about what's happening on the wire.

---

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is debug code** - remember to remove these console.log statements before final production merge. They're intentionally aggressive to expose the full picture.

‚úÖ **This is safe** - it only adds logging, doesn't change any logic or behavior.

‚úÖ **This is temporary** - once we identify the issue, these logs go away.
