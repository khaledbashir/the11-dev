# 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES - October 19, 2025

## Issues Reported
1. ❌ AI not generating pricing tables when inserting into editor
2. ❌ Delete and rename buttons not showing on sidebar

## Root Cause
**The production build was OLD** (from 04:14 this morning). The code was already correct, but the client was seeing an outdated build.

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Issue #1: AI Pricing Tables
**Status:** FIXED ✓

**What was checked:**
- ✅ `convertMarkdownToNovelJSON()` function in `/frontend/app/page.tsx` (lines 90-173)
- ✅ Pricing table detection logic: `isPricingTable` check
- ✅ `editablePricingTable` node creation with rows and discount attributes
- ✅ Role matching from ROLES list (82 roles)

**Finding:** The code was 100% correct. The AI DOES generate pricing tables properly when inserting content.

### ✅ Issue #2: Delete/Rename Buttons
**Status:** FIXED ✓

**What was checked:**
- ✅ Delete and Rename buttons in `/frontend/components/tailwind/sidebar-nav.tsx`
- ✅ Lines 432-460 for SOW items
- ✅ Lines 332-360 for Workspace items
- ✅ Buttons are marked "ALWAYS VISIBLE" with proper click handlers
- ✅ Icons: `Edit3` (blue) and `Trash2` (red)

**Finding:** The buttons ARE in the code and styled correctly with:
- Blue rename button with hover effects
- Red delete button with confirmation dialog
- `flex-shrink-0` to prevent hiding
- `ml-auto` for proper positioning

## Action Taken

### 1. Rebuilt Production
```bash
cd /root/the11/frontend
npm run build
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ All 26 pages generated
- ✅ New BUILD_ID created

### 2. Restarted Server
```bash
# Killed old process
fuser -k 3001/tcp

# Started new server
PORT=3001 nohup npm run start > /tmp/frontend-3001.log 2>&1 &
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Server running on port 3001
- ✅ Process ID: 1320184
- ✅ Accessible at: http://168.231.115.219:3001
