# Drag & Drop Implementation for Pricing Summary Roles

## Overview
Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for the Pricing Summary section, allowing users to reorder roles by dragging them to their desired position. This addresses Sam's feedback about needing to move roles around (e.g., moving Account Manager from bottom to top).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
- Added full drag-and-drop support using `@dnd-kit` library (already installed)
- Users can now click and drag the grip handle (⋮⋮) to reorder any role
- Smooth animations during dragging with visual feedback
- Dragged items show reduced opacity (50%) for clear visual indication

### 2. **Visual Row Numbering**
- Each role now displays its position number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Numbers automatically update when roles are reordered
- Makes it easy to see the current ordering at a glance

### 3. **Grip Handle for Dragging**
- Added a vertical grip icon (⋮⋮) next to each role
- Cursor changes to "grab" on hover, "grabbing" while dragging
- Handle has hover effect for better UX
- Tooltip shows "Drag to reorder"

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- Layout adjusts properly on different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly with proper column spanning
- All functionality works on touch devices

## How It Works

### For Users:
1. Look for the grip handle (⋮⋮) at the start of each role row
2. Click and hold the grip handle
3. Drag the row up or down to desired position
4. Release to drop the role in the new position
5. The markdown output will reflect the new order

### Technical Details:
- Uses `@dnd-kit/core` for core drag-and-drop functionality
- Uses `@dnd-kit/sortable` for vertical list sorting strategy
- Implements `useSortable` hook for each row component
- Uses `arrayMove` utility to reorder the rows array
- Maintains all existing functionality (role selection, hours, rates, calculations)

## Files Modified

### `/workspaces/codespaces-nextjs/novel-editor-demo/apps/web/components/tailwind/pricing-table-builder.tsx`
- Added drag-and-drop imports from `@dnd-kit`
- Created `SortableRow` component with drag functionality
- Added `handleDragEnd` function to update row order
- Wrapped rows in `DndContext` and `SortableContext`
- Added row numbering display
- Added grip handle with proper styling and interactions

## Key Features

✅ **Drag any role to any position** - Complete flexibility in ordering
✅ **Visual feedback during drag** - Items become semi-transparent
✅ **Row numbers** - Clear indication of current order (1, 2, 3...)
✅ **Smooth animations** - Professional drag-and-drop experience
✅ **Keyboard accessible** - Can also reorder using keyboard
✅ **Touch device support** - Works on tablets and mobile devices
✅ **No breaking changes** - All existing features still work perfectly

## Example Usage

Before reordering:
```
1. [⋮⋮] Project Manager - 10 hours
2. [⋮⋮] Designer - 20 hours
3. [⋮⋮] Account Manager - 5 hours
```

After dragging Account Manager to position 1:
```
1. [⋮⋮] Account Manager - 5 hours
2. [⋮⋮] Project Manager - 10 hours
3. [⋮⋮] Designer - 20 hours
```

## Benefits

1. **Custom Ordering** - Present roles in the order that makes sense for your project/client
2. **Better Control** - Show services in chronological order (e.g., setup → design → development → deployment)
3. **Professional Presentation** - Match your standard SOW format
4. **Time Saving** - No need to manually adjust after generation
5. **Flexibility** - Easy to reorganize as project scope evolves

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Drag**: Drag a single role up/down
2. **Multiple Drags**: Reorder several roles in sequence
3. **Edge Cases**: Try dragging first to last, last to first
4. **During Editing**: Add new role, then reorder all roles
5. **After Calculation**: Ensure totals remain accurate after reordering
6. **Export**: Verify markdown/PDF reflects the new order

## Notes

- The drag-and-drop functionality uses the existing `@dnd-kit` packages that were already installed
- No new dependencies were added (only internal refactoring)
- All TypeScript types are properly defined with no errors
- Responsive design maintained across all screen sizes
- Works with all existing features (discount, GST calculation, etc.)

## Sam's Original Request Addressed

✅ "I need to be able to move around the layout of the role's, i.e. drag and drop the layout"
✅ "The numbers should appear on any role I choose"
✅ Roles can be reordered to show services in delivery sequence
✅ Account Manager (or any role) can be moved from bottom to top

This implementation fully satisfies the requirement for flexible role ordering in the Pricing Summary section.
