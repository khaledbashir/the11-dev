### 3. âœ… Interactive Pricing Table Builder Created

- **Toggle visibility** via "Build Pricing Table" button in header

#### Technical Implementation:

- Uses existing UI components (Select, Input, Button, Label)
- Converts pricing data to markdown format
- Inserts directly into Novel editor via convertMarkdownToNovelJSON
