## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Drag-drop not working?
- Make sure you're clicking the grip handle (⋮⋮)
- Don't click the name/text - only the grip
- Try clicking and holding for a moment before dragging

### Folders not highlighting?
- Drag slower over the folder
- Make sure you're fully over the folder area
- Folder should show green ring when ready

### Changes not saving?
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- LocalStorage might be full - clear some old SOWs
- Try refreshing the page

### Export not working?
- Make sure you've added content to your SOW
- Check that API key is set (for AI generation)
- Try exporting again
