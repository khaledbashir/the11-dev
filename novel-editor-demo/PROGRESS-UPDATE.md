## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REMAINING

### Priority 1: PDF Export - Pricing Table
**Issue**: Editable pricing table is a React component, won't render in PDF
**Solution Needed**: 
- Detect pricing table nodes in editor HTML
- Extract pricing data from node attributes
- Render as static HTML table in PDF
- Include summary section with calculations

### Priority 2: Budget Adherence
**Issue**: "10k budget returned 35k SOW"
**Solution Needed**:
- Update `THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` with stricter budget logic
- Add budget validation
- Provide examples of budget-constrained scoping
- Test with Sam's $4k example

### Priority 3: Deliverables Format
**Issue**: Coming out as paragraphs, not hierarchical bullets
**Sam's Required Format**:
```
HubSpot Implementation & Configuration Deliverables
1x Marketing, Service & Content Hub Implementation

Initial Account Configuration
+ General settings setup
+ Testing sandbox setup
 ‚Äì Example detail level 1
 ‚Äì Example detail level 2
```

**Solution Needed**:
- Update AI prompt with exact formatting rules
- Provide multiple examples
- Update markdown converter to handle `+` and `‚Äì` bullets

### Priority 4: Role Allocation
**Issue**: Only 1-2 roles, need 5-7 per project
**Solution Needed**:
- Add Sam's support retainer examples to prompt
- Emphasize multiple roles per phase
- Include examples showing proper allocation
- Test with HubSpot example (should have PM, AM, Specialist, Producer, Coordinator)

### Priority 5: Document Management
**Issues**:
- Folders disappearing
- Can't rename documents
- Can't delete documents
- No auto-naming from AI

**Solution Needed**:
- Auto-rename docs based on client name from SOW
- Add rename/delete UI (right-click menu or inline)
- Fix localStorage persistence
- Implement proper document lifecycle

### Priority 6: Folder Drag-Drop
**Issue**: "drag and drop didn't work to move scopes into folders"
**Solution Needed**:
- Implement @dnd-kit for documents
- Visual feedback during drag
- Drop zones on folders
- Test thoroughly

### Priority 7: Duplicate New SOW Button
**Issue**: Two entry points causing confusion
**Solution Needed**:
- Remove one button (probably from sidebar)
- Keep header button only
- Make sidebar show document history

### Priority 8: Dropdown Not Working
**Issue**: "I used the drop down to select a different task/job for design and it didn't change"
**Solution Needed**:
- Debug editablePricingTable component
- Verify onChange handler
- Test rate auto-population
- Test all 82 roles

### Priority 9: Role Reordering
**Issue**: Can't drag roles to reorder
**Solution Needed**:
- Implement @dnd-kit/sortable in pricing table
- Draggable table rows
- Visual feedback

### Priority 10: GST Display
**Issue**: Should show "+GST" on each line, not just summary
**Solution Needed**:
- Update pricing table display
- Show "+GST" next to individual costs
- Keep summary calculation

### Priority 11: Toggle Summary Price
**Issue**: Need to hide grand total for multi-option SOWs
**Solution Needed**:
- Add toggle button
- Show/hide total section
- Persist state

   - Test with pricing table in document

3. **Update AI Prompt**

   - Add role allocation examples
   - Test with "$4k HubSpot integration" example

4. **Implement Document Management**
