# ✅ API Route Works - Issue is Client-Side!

## Test Results

### API Route Test ✅
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/generate ...
```

**Response**: 
```json
{"error":{"message":"Insufficient credits..."}}
```

This means:
- ✅ API route is accessible
- ✅ Server is running
- ✅ Request reaches the API
- ❌ OpenRouter API key needs credits

BUT the browser error is **"Failed to fetch"** which means the browser can't reach the API at all!

## Root Cause

The **"Failed to fetch"** error in the browser happens BEFORE the API is even called. This is a client-side issue, not a server issue.

### Possible Causes:

1. **useCompletion Hook Issue**
   - The AI SDK's `useCompletion` might have a bug
   - Or we're using it incorrectly
   - The hook might be trying to connect before the component is ready

2. **Editor State Issue**
   - `editor.state.selection` might be undefined
   - `editor.storage.markdown` might not exist
   - This causes an error before the fetch even happens

3. **Async/Await Issue**
   - The `complete()` function might not be ready
   - Component unmounting during call
   - Race condition

## The Real Fix

Since the API works with curl but not from the browser, the issue is in how we're calling `complete()`.

Let me check if the editor is ready...
