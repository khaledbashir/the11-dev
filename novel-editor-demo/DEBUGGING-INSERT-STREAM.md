# ðŸ”§ Fixing Insert Button & Stream Errors

## Issues Found:

1. **Insert button not working** - Button click may not be triggering properly
2. **Stream parsing error** - AI sometimes adds preamble text like "Here's the fixed formatting..."

## Fixes Needed:

### Fix 1: Insert Button

## Solution:

Let me add debugging and improve error handling...
