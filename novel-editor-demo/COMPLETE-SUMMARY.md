## 🚫 NOT IMPLEMENTED (NEEDS FURTHER WORK)

### 1. **"Ask AI" Feature - Switch to OpenRouter**
**STATUS**: Needs investigation and implementation

**ISSUE**: When highlighting text in the editor and clicking "Ask AI", it currently uses OpenAI API. Should use OpenRouter (same as chat) with model selection.

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Find "Ask AI" implementation in codebase
2. Switch API endpoint to OpenRouter
3. Add model selector dropdown
4. Test with multiple models

---

### 2. **Toggle Total Price Visibility**
**YOUR REQUEST**: "Can there be a button to toggle on and off the summarised price of all scopes of work"

**STATUS**: Not yet implemented

**USE CASE**: When showing 3 options, sometimes you don't want to show the combined total, just individual prices.

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Add toggle button to pricing table
2. Show/hide final summary section
3. Maintain individual SOW prices

---

### 3. **Support Retainer Examples in Knowledge Base**
**YOUR REQUEST**: Provided examples of 40-hour support retainer roles and deliverables

**STATUS**: Can be added to knowledge base

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Add your support retainer examples to `/lib/knowledge-base.ts`
2. Include typical roles (Tech Producer, Specialist, Sr. Consultant, etc.)
3. Include typical hours allocation
4. Include deliverable templates

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. **Test Drag & Drop**:
   ```
   - Create some SOWs (use + button in sidebar)
   - Create some folders (use folder+ button)
   - Try dragging SOWs into folders
   - Try dragging roles in pricing table
   - Verify everything feels smooth
   ```

2. **Set Up OpenRouter** (CRITICAL):
   ```
   - Go to https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys
   - Sign up if you haven't
   - Go to "Credits" and add $10-20
   - Go to "Keys" and create new API key
   - Provide the API key to the system
   ```

3. **Test Features**:
   ```
   - Create a new SOW
   - Chat with The Architect to generate content
   - Insert a pricing table
   - Add roles and drag them around
   - Add a discount percentage
   - Export to PDF
   - Verify everything looks professional
   ```

### NICE TO HAVE:

4. **Provide Support Retainer Data**:
   - Send the full list of support retainer roles/rates
   - Send typical deliverables text
   - I'll add them to the knowledge base

5. **Identify "Ask AI" Feature**:
   - Show me where this feature is (screenshot or description)
   - I'll switch it to OpenRouter
