### 4. **Duplicate 'Create SOW' Buttons Fixed** ‚úÖ

- Smooth animations with visual feedback

**How to use**:
1. Open Pricing Table Builder
2. Click and hold grip handle next to any role
3. Drag up or down to desired position
4. Release to drop

**Files modified**:

## ‚úì ALREADY WORKING FEATURES

### 6. **Chat Formatting - Tables & Spacing** ‚úì
**Status**: ALREADY PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED

**What's working**:
- Chat uses `ReactMarkdown` with full formatting support
- Tables render with proper styling (green header, borders, hover effects)
- Code blocks render with syntax highlighting
- Lists (bullet and numbered) render correctly
- Headings (H1, H2, H3) with proper hierarchy
- Bold, italic, blockquotes all supported
- Proper spacing between elements

**Technical details**:
- Custom component overrides for all markdown elements
- Social Garden green theme (#2C823D) for table headers
- Responsive table scrolling for wide tables
- Proper foreground/background contrast

**Files**: `/components/tailwind/agent-sidebar-clean.tsx` (lines 520-615)

---

### 7. **Slash Command - Clickable Menu** ‚úì
**Status**: ALREADY WORKING AS DESIGNED

**What's working**:
- Type "/" in editor to open slash command menu
- Menu is fully clickable (using Novel's built-in Command extension)
- Can navigate with arrow keys or click with mouse
- Search/filter commands by typing
- Each command has icon, title, and description
- Commands include: Text, Headings, Lists, Quote, Code, Image, YouTube, Twitter

**How it works**:
1. Type "/" in the editor
2. Menu appears with all available commands
3. Click any command OR type to search/filter
4. Click Enter or click with mouse to insert

**Note**: This is NOT a chat feature - it's an editor feature for inserting content blocks

**Files**: `/components/tailwind/slash-command.tsx` - Uses Novel's Command extension

## üîÑ NEEDS INVESTIGATION

### 8. **"Ask AI" Feature - Switch to OpenRouter**
**Status**: NEEDS CODE REVIEW

**User request**:
- Currently uses OpenAI for "Ask AI" (when highlighting text in editor)
- Should use OpenRouter API (same as chat)
- Should have model selector (same dropdown as chat)

**Investigation needed**:
- Find where "Ask AI" feature is implemented
- Check current API endpoint
- Update to use OpenRouter
- Add model selection UI

**Next steps**: Search for "Ask AI", "highlight", "selection" features in codebase

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAM

1. **OpenRouter Setup**: Sign up at https://openrouter.ai/, add credits ($10-20), generate API key
2. **Test All Features**: Go through the checklist above and verify everything works
3. **Knowledge Base**: Provide the support retainer examples to add to AI context
4. **Feedback**: Test the new drag-drop features and provide feedback on UX
5. **Model Selection**: Try different AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) to see which generates best SOWs

---

## üìû SUPPORT

If any issues arise:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify localStorage isn't full (can cause persistence issues)
3. Clear cache if strange behavior occurs
4. Ensure OpenRouter API key is valid and has credits
