## 🎯 NEXT DEVELOPER PRIORITIES (October 23)

### ✅ COMPLETED (October 23, 2025)
1. **✅ FIXED - Chat disappearing bug** (Commits: 10687ec, a8d4044)
   - **Portal issue**: Quick question buttons had race condition with state updates
     - Solution: Created `sendQuickQuestion()` function that takes question as parameter
   - **Dashboard issue** (THE REAL BUG): useEffect with `documents` dependency was clearing chat on every auto-save
     - Root cause: Auto-save updates `documents` array → triggers useEffect → clears `chatMessages`
     - Solution: Removed `documents` from dependency array in line 713
   - Result: Chat messages now persist properly after sending in BOTH portal and dashboard ✅

2. **✅ VERIFIED - `/api/admin/services` endpoint**
   - Endpoint exists at `frontend/app/api/admin/services/route.ts`
   - Database has 14 active services in `service_catalog` table
   - False alarm - no fix needed

3. **✅ VERIFIED - Excel export functionality**
   - Button exists in sidebar with proper handleDownloadExcel function
   - Creates 3-sheet workbook (Overview, Content, Pricing)
   - No issues found in code - ready for user testing

4. **✅ VERIFIED - Logo files**
   - Logo files exist: `/public/images/logo-light.png` and `logo-dark.png`
   - 404 error likely due to EasyPanel cache - will resolve after next deploy

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes Needed (From Console Errors)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR NEXT DEVELOPERS:** These issues were discovered during testing on October 25, 2025. Push changes to GitHub and EasyPanel will auto-deploy them.

### Issue 1: Tiptap Markdown Serialization Error
- **Error:** `Tiptap Markdown: "editablePricingTable" node is only available in html mode`
- **Location:** `tiptap-markdown.es.js:243`
- **Impact:** Markdown export may fail for SOWs with pricing tables
- **Fix Needed:** Ensure `editablePricingTable` node properly handles markdown serialization
- **File:** `frontend/components/tailwind/extensions.ts` (TipTap node definitions)
- **Action:** [ ] Add markdown serialization handler to editablePricingTable node
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### Issue 2: Extension Context Invalidated (Browser Extension)
- **Error:** `Uncaught Error: Extension context invalidated` (appears 5+ times)
- **Location:** `content.js:10`
- **Impact:** Likely from browser extension (not app code), may interfere with AI features
- **Cause:** Browser extension attempting to access invalidated context
- **Fix Needed:** Not app-related, but verify if extension is interfering with OpenRouter API calls
- **Action:** [ ] Test in incognito mode to confirm extension issue
- **Priority:** LOW (non-critical, browser extension issue)

### Issue 3: OpenRouter API 401 Authentication Error
- **Error:** `Failed to load resource: /api/generate returned 401`
- **Error Detail:** `Generation error: Error: API error: 401`
- **Location:** `floating-ai-bar.tsx:237`
- **Impact:** Inline AI text generation (Expand/Rewrite) not working
- **Cause:** OpenRouter API key missing, expired, or not sent correctly
- **Fix Needed:** 
  - [ ] Verify `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env var is set in frontend `.env`
  - [ ] Check `/api/generate` route is sending API key in headers
  - [ ] Verify API key is valid on OpenRouter dashboard
  - [ ] Check rate limit on OpenRouter account
- **Files:** 
  - `frontend/.env` (env var)
  - `frontend/app/api/generate/route.ts` (endpoint)
- **Priority:** HIGH (AI features depend on this)
- **Deployment Note:** After fix, PUSH to GitHub → EasyPanel auto-deploys

### Issue 4: editablePricingTable Node Visibility
- **Error:** `"editablePricingTable" node is only available in html mode`
- **Location:** SOW editor when rendering pricing tables
- **Impact:** Pricing tables may not render in markdown/export views
- **Fix Needed:** 
  - [ ] Verify editablePricingTable node is exported in TipTap schema
  - [ ] Ensure HTML conversion includes pricing table rendering
  - [ ] Add fallback for markdown export (convert to plain text table)
- **File:** `frontend/components/tailwind/extensions.ts`
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

## 📋 Deployment Workflow (Important for Auto-Deploy)

**How changes get deployed to production:**

1. Make code changes locally or in VS Code
2. Test locally: `npm run dev`
3. **COMMIT to Git:** `git add -A && git commit -m "fix: ..."`
4. **PUSH to GitHub:** `git push origin enterprise-grade-ux`
5. **EasyPanel auto-deploys:** 
   - EasyPanel watches GitHub branch `enterprise-grade-ux`
   - Automatically builds and deploys when new commits pushed
   - No manual deploy needed - auto-deployment handles everything
6. **Test in production:** Visit https://sow.qandu.me
7. **Fix any issues:** Same workflow (commit → push → auto-deploy)

**Key Points:**
- Every `git push` triggers an auto-deploy on EasyPanel ✅
- Don't forget to `git push` or changes won't deploy!
- Commits in this repo should explain the fix clearly (for future developers)
- If deploy fails, check EasyPanel dashboard for build errors
keypoints theres also  3 kinds of ai  one for dashboar one for generation they work it7s just th einline editor doesnt work 
---

**Next Action:** Fix OpenRouter API 401 error (Issue #3)  
**Responsible:** Development Team  
**Review:** Sam (Product Manager)  
**Deployment:** After fix, `git push origin enterprise-grade-ux` for auto-deploy
