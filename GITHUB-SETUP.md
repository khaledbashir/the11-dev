# GitHub Authentication Setup

## Current Status
- ✅ Project cleaned: `the11` repository (khaledbashir account)
- ✅ Git history fixed: No large files, ready to push
- ❌ Authentication: Need GitHub Personal Access Token

## What You Need To Do (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Generate Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name: `the11-push-token`
4. Set expiration: **90 days** (or whatever you prefer)
5. Check these permissions:
   - ✅ `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (if you use GitHub Actions)
6. Click **"Generate token"** at the bottom
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Give Token to Me
Send the token, and I'll:
1. ✅ Store it in git credential helper
2. ✅ Force push cleaned code to `streaming-reasoning-model-feature` branch
3. ✅ Verify everything is on GitHub
4. ✅ Clean up the token from memory

## After This
- You can create new branches anytime
- No more git size issues
- Ready to migrate to new repo if needed later
