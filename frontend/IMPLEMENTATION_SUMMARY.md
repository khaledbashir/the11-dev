## üéØ Quick Start for Next Developer

### To add PDF export:
1. Wire up `handleExportPDF()` in `page.tsx` to use `exportToPDF()` from `export-utils.ts`
2. Add logo file to `/public/assets/Logo-Dark-Green.png`
3. Test with a sample SOW document

### To add discount controls:
1. Create `/components/tailwind/discount-controls.tsx`
2. Add discount fields (type: %, fixed; amount)
3. Update document state to include discount
4. Modify pricing table rendering to show discounts

### To test AI generation:
1. Click "New SOW"
2. Chat: "Create a HubSpot Implementation SOW for ABC Corp, 3 hubs, budget $50,000"
3. Type `/inserttosow` when AI generates the SOW
4. Verify formatting, roles, pricing, deliverables

2. **/inserttosow command** - Simple command to insert AI-generated content into editor
3. **Automatic document naming** - Extracts title from SOW and renames document automatically
4. **localStorage first** - Quick development, migrate to Supabase when ready

## üìû Questions for Sam

1. **Logo file:** Can you provide `Logo-Dark-Green.png` for PDF headers?
2. **Banner images:** Do you have banner/letterhead images for SOW PDFs?
3. **Discount workflow:** When should discount be applied? During AI generation or after?
4. **Folder structure:** How deep should folder nesting go? (1 level, 2 levels, unlimited?)
5. **Export defaults:** Should PDF always include logo? Should Excel include formulas?
