# CRITICAL FIXES: Core Application Bugs (October 25, 2025)

## Mission: Fix Rogue Prompt Injection & Implement Thinking Tag Parser

### Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Code pushed to GitHub

---

## Executive Summary

Two critical **application-level bugs** were causing the AI interaction system to malfunction:

1. **Bug #1: Rogue Prompt Injection** - The "JSON contract" instruction was being appended to EVERY user message, even simple greetings like "hi", forcing the AI to incorrectly generate SOWs and placeholder templates for casual questions.

2. **Bug #2: Thinking Tag Leak** - The application was not parsing the `<thinking>` tags that the new superior prompt instructed the AI to use for internal monologue, causing the entire debug output to be displayed to users in the chat window.

Both issues have been **surgically fixed** in the application code, and the changes are now deployed to GitHub.

## Bug #1: Rogue Prompt Injection (FIXED ‚úÖ)

### What Was Happening

In `frontend/app/page.tsx`, the code was appending a "contract suffix" to every user message:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Always appended, regardless of context
const contractSuffix = "IMPORTANT: Your response MUST contain two parts in order: first, a complete SOW narrative written in Markdown, and second, a single ```json code block...";
const requestMessages = [
  ...
  newMessages.length > 0
    ? {
        role: newMessages[newMessages.length - 1].role,
        content: `${newMessages[newMessages.length - 1].content.trim()}\n\n${contractSuffix}`,
      }
    : undefined,
];
```

**Result:** When a user typed "hi", the AI received: `"hi\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response MUST contain two parts..."`, creating a logical conflict forcing the AI to generate a nonsensical placeholder SOW.

### The Fix

Made the contract suffix **conditional** - only append when in actual SOW generation mode:

```typescript
// AFTER: Conditional based on mode
const isSowGenerationMode = !isDashboardMode;
const contractSuffix = isSowGenerationMode 
  ? "IMPORTANT: Your response MUST contain two parts in order: first, a complete SOW narrative written in Markdown, and second, a single ```json code block..."
  : "";

const requestMessages = [
  ...
  newMessages.length > 0
    ? {
        role: newMessages[newMessages.length - 1].role,
        content: isSowGenerationMode
          ? `${newMessages[newMessages.length - 1].content.trim()}\n\n${contractSuffix}`
          : newMessages[newMessages.length - 1].content,
      }
    : undefined,
];
```

**Result:** Dashboard queries (including simple greetings) no longer get the JSON contract appended, so the AI can respond naturally.

### Locations Fixed

- **Streaming Mode**: Lines 3060-3082 (streaming chat with AnythingLLM)
- **Non-Streaming Mode**: Lines 3340-3358 (fallback for OpenRouter)

## Bug #2: Thinking Tag Leak (FIXED ‚úÖ)

### What Was Happening

The new system prompt instructs the AI to wrap internal reasoning in `<thinking></thinking>` tags:

```
<thinking>
The user just said "hi" - a simple greeting. They're not asking for a SOW. 
I should respond naturally with a greeting, not generate a SOW template.
This is clearly a casual conversation starter...
</thinking>

Hello! How can I help you draft an SOW today?
```

But the application was **not parsing these tags**, so it displayed the entire raw response:

```
<thinking>
The user just said "hi" - a simple greeting...
</thinking>

Hello! How can I help...
```

Users saw the debug output (thinking monologue) in the chat window, which was confusing and unprofessional.

### The Fix

Added regex-based thinking tag stripping at every point where stream data is accumulated:

**Main Stream Handling (line 3183):**
```typescript
if (data.type === 'textResponseChunk' && data.textResponse) {
  // üß† Strip <thinking> tags before accumulating content
  const cleanedText = data.textResponse.replace(/<thinking>[\s\S]*?<\/thinking>/gi, '');
  accumulatedContent += cleanedText;
  // ... update UI
}
```

**Final Response (line 3200):**
```typescript
} else if (data.type === 'textResponse') {
  // üß† Also strip <thinking> tags from final responses
  let content = data.content || data.textResponse || '';
  content = content.replace(/<thinking>[\s\S]*?<\/thinking>/gi, '');
  accumulatedContent = content;
  // ... update UI
}
```

**Follow-up Requests (lines 3309-3318):**
```typescript
if (data2.type === 'textResponseChunk' && data2.textResponse) {
  // üß† Strip <thinking> tags from follow-up chunks too
  const cleanedText2 = data2.textResponse.replace(/<thinking>[\s\S]*?<\/thinking>/gi, '');
  accumulatedJson += cleanedText2;
}
```

**Result:** All `<thinking>...</thinking>` content is silently removed before displaying to the user. Only the actual response is shown.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario: User types "hi"

**Before Fix:**
```
User: hi

[Rogue suffix appended in background: "IMPORTANT: Your response MUST contain two parts..."]

AI Response:
<thinking>
The user wants me to generate a SOW with JSON. They just said "hi" 
but the system is forcing me to generate two parts: markdown + JSON.
I need to satisfy both the greeting AND the JSON requirement...
</thinking>

# New SOW
[generates placeholder SOW]

```json
{
  "scopeItems": [...]
}
```

[Wall of debug text visible to user]
```

**After Fix:**
```
User: hi

[No rogue suffix - dashboard mode detected, greeting stays as-is]

AI Response:
<thinking>
The user just said hello. This is a casual greeting. I should respond naturally.
</thinking>  ‚Üê Automatically stripped, user never sees this

Hello! How can I help you draft an SOW today?
```

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` (3791 lines total)

### Changes Made
- **Lines 3060-3082**: Fixed streaming mode prompt injection (made conditional)
- **Lines 3340-3358**: Fixed non-streaming mode prompt injection (made conditional)
- **Line 3183**: Added thinking tag regex stripping for streamed chunks
- **Line 3200**: Added thinking tag regex stripping for final responses
- **Lines 3309-3318**: Added thinking tag regex stripping for follow-up requests

### Regex Pattern Used
```typescript
content.replace(/<thinking>[\s\S]*?<\/thinking>/gi, '')
```
- Matches `<thinking>` and `</thinking>` (case-insensitive with `i` flag)
- `[\s\S]*?` captures any content between tags (including newlines) non-greedily
- `g` flag removes ALL occurrences in the content string

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Code committed to GitHub**
- Commit: `fadc2fc`
- Message: `fix(core): fix rogue prompt injection and implement thinking tag parser`
- Branch: `enterprise-grade-ux`
- Pushed: ‚úÖ Yes

### Ready for Verification

Once deployed to production, verify the fix by:
1. Opening the Master Dashboard (Analytics view)
2. Type: `hi`
3. **Expected:** Simple greeting response with no SOW template
4. **Verify:** No `<thinking>` tags visible, clean response text

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened

1. **Bug #1 Root Cause**: The contract suffix was intended to enforce JSON output for SOW generation mode, but it was hardcoded into the request message construction without checking whether the current context was actually SOW generation vs. analytics query.

2. **Bug #2 Root Cause**: The new superior prompt (with thinking tags) was introduced, but the stream parsing logic wasn't updated to handle and strip these tags before displaying to the user.

### Prevention for Future

- **Type the context before adding requirements**: Check the current mode (dashboard vs. editor) before appending AI instructions
- **Keep stream parsers up-to-date**: When adding new AI output formats (like thinking tags), ensure the UI layer knows how to handle them

---

## Impact

This fix transforms the user experience:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard queries work correctly (no spurious SOW generation)
- ‚úÖ Casual greetings are answered naturally
- ‚úÖ No debug output visible to end users
- ‚úÖ AI system works as originally designed (the prompt was never the problem - the application's use of it was)

The AI itself is functioning perfectly - these were pure application bugs that prevented the intelligent AI system from working as intended.

## Verification Checklist

After deployment:
- [ ] Try "hi" in dashboard ‚Üí expect greeting
- [ ] Try "Can you help me?" in dashboard ‚Üí expect natural response
- [ ] Try SOW generation in Editor mode ‚Üí expect SOW + JSON
- [ ] Look for `<thinking>` tags in any response ‚Üí should find NONE
- [ ] Check browser console ‚Üí should see no new errors
