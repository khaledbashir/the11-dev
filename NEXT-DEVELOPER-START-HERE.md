## ‚ö° What To Do Next (Priority Order)

### 1. üî¥ HIGH - Fix OpenRouter API 401 Error
**Why:** Inline AI generation broken (Expand/Rewrite buttons)  
**Error:** `Failed to load resource: /api/generate returned 401`  
**Location:** `floating-ai-bar.tsx:237`  
**Fix Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check frontend .env for OPENROUTER_API_KEY
cat frontend/.env | grep OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# 2. If missing, add it
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-..." >> frontend/.env

# 3. Verify route has the key
cat frontend/app/api/generate/route.ts

# 4. Test locally
cd frontend && npm run dev

# 5. If fixed, commit and push (auto-deploys)
git add -A && git commit -m "fix: Add OpenRouter API key to generate endpoint"
git push origin enterprise-grade-ux
```

### 2. üü° MEDIUM - Verify UI Elements Visibility

**Discount Section:**
- [ ] View `/portal/sow/[id]?id=1` (any SOW ID)
- [ ] Click "Pricing" tab
- [ ] Verify "Discount (%)" slider is visible and prominent
- [ ] If not obvious, make it bigger/highlight it

**Price Toggle:**
- [ ] Same page, same tab
- [ ] Find "Hide Grand Total" button
- [ ] Verify it's obvious and clickable
- [ ] If not, make it more prominent

**What to do if not visible:**
```bash
# Edit the portal page
nano frontend/app/portal/sow/[id]/page.tsx

# Search for "hideGrandTotal" or "Discount"
# Make styling more prominent (add bg color, increase size, etc)

# Test locally, then:
git add -A && git commit -m "ui: Make discount and price toggle more prominent"
git push origin enterprise-grade-ux
```

### 3. üü° MEDIUM - Test Scope Assumptions in SOWs

**To verify it works:**
```bash
# 1. Go to Architect/SOW generator in app
# 2. Generate a new SOW for a test project
# 3. Check if output has "## Scope Assumptions" section
# 4. Verify it appears AFTER "Project Outcomes"
# 5. Verify it appears BEFORE "Project Phases"

# If it doesn't appear:
# - Check THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT in frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts
# - Look for "MANDATORY SECTION ORDER" comment
# - Re-read the enforcement section
# - Strengthen it further if needed
```

### 4. üü° MEDIUM - Test Management Services Section

**To verify it works:**
- Same as #3 above
- Look for "## Account & Project Management Services" section
- Should list 6 bullet points:
  * Project kick-off meeting
  * Weekly project status updates
  * Internal briefing
  * Change request management
  * Risk and issue escalation
  * Post-delivery knowledge transfer

**If missing:** Strengthen prompt in `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`

## üÜò If Something Breaks

**Step 1: Check the console**

# Take a screenshot of error
```

**Step 2: Check the issue list**
```bash
# Open: SOW-REQUIREMENTS-CHECKLIST.md
# Look in "üêõ Known Issues & Fixes Needed" section
# Your error might already be documented there
```

**Step 3: Search for similar issues**
```bash
cd /root/the11-dev
grep -r "error message" --include="*.md"
# Search documentation for that error
```

**Step 4: Check git log**
```bash
git log --oneline --grep="similar keyword"
# See if someone fixed similar issue before
```

**Step 5: Revert if needed**
```bash
# Last commit broke things? Revert it:
git revert HEAD
git push origin enterprise-grade-ux

# Or go back to specific commit:
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push -f origin enterprise-grade-ux
```

5. **Document your work** - Next developer will thank you
6. **Check SOW-REQUIREMENTS-CHECKLIST.md** - It's your map
