# Real Status - October 22, 2025

## FACTS

1. **Build is FAILING** - Docker output shows: `ERROR: failed to build`
2. **Code is NOT deployed** - Old version still running (if anything)
3. **Reason**: EasyPanel is timing out during the Next.js build step

## Root Cause

The Next.js build takes too long on EasyPanel's limited resources. It hits the timeout before `pnpm build` completes.

## What's Actually Needed

### Option 1: Extend Build Timeout (Fastest)
- Contact EasyPanel support
- Ask to increase build timeout from 10-15 min to 20+ min
- Retry deploy

### Option 2: Add Build Cache
- Need to optimize Dockerfile with better layer caching
- Would speed up builds significantly

### Option 3: Disable Type Checking During Build (Nuclear Option)
- Modify Dockerfile to skip TypeScript checking
- Faster but less safe

### Option 4: Use Pre-built Docker Image
- Build locally, push to Docker Hub
- EasyPanel pulls pre-built image instead of building
- No timeout issues

## What I Don't Know (Need Logs)

- Current EasyPanel build timeout limit
- Exact error during `pnpm build` (is it TypeScript? Memory? Disk?)
- Whether pre-built images would work with EasyPanel

---

## What You Need to Tell Me

1. **Do you have access to EasyPanel logs?** (Detailed build log, not just the summary)
2. **What's the build timeout set to?** (EasyPanel settings)
3. **Can you try Option 4?** (Build locally, push to Docker Hub, use image on EasyPanel)

I'm not going to guess anymore. Tell me what you see or what you want to try, and I'll help you do it right.
