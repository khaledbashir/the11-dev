# ‚úÖ SAM GOSSAGE 5-POINT SOW REQUIREMENTS - FULLY ENFORCED

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Commit:** `34f721c` - "enforce: ALL 5 Sam Gossage SOW requirements - mandatory roles, role allocation strategy, rounding, discount mechanism"  
**Status:** üöÄ LOCKED INTO THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT

---

## Overview

The AI Architect system now enforces **ALL 5 requirements** that Sam Gossage specified for proper SOW generation. Every scope of work generated will follow these rules or fail validation.

---

## THE 5 REQUIREMENTS (Now Enforced)

### ‚úÖ **Requirement 1: Mandatory 3-Role Team Composition**

**What Sam Required:**
> Every SOW must consistently include three specific management/coordination roles:
> 1. Account Management (Account Manager or Senior Account Manager): 6-12 hours
> 2. Project Coordination (Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination): 3-10 hours  
> 3. Senior Management (Head Of Senior Project Management or equivalent): 5-15 hours

**What Was Wrong:**
The generated example SOW was missing **both Account Management AND Project Coordination** entirely. It had only a single "Project Manager" role, which doesn't fulfill Sam's requirement for distinct coordination and senior management layers.

**How It's Fixed:**
- Added to section 9 (REQUIRED ELEMENTS): "MANDATORY TEAM COMPOSITION (SAM GOSSAGE REQUIREMENT)"
- Prompt now explicitly states: "EVERY scope MUST include these THREE roles in pricing table"
- If these three roles are NOT present, **the SOW is INCOMPLETE and INVALID**
- Validation checklist explicitly checks for all three

**Code Location:**
```typescript
// frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts - Lines ~260-275

**MANDATORY TEAM COMPOSITION (SAM GOSSAGE REQUIREMENT):**
EVERY scope MUST include these THREE roles in pricing table:
1. **Account Management** (Senior Account Manager or Account Manager) - 6-12 hours minimum
2. **Project Coordination** (Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination) - 3-10 hours minimum
3. **Senior Management** (Head Of Senior Project Management or equivalent "Head Of" role) - 5-15 hours minimum

If these three roles are NOT present, the SOW is INCOMPLETE and INVALID.
```

### ‚úÖ **Requirement 2: Account Manager at BOTTOM of Role List**

**What Sam Required:**
> Account Management hours must ALWAYS appear at the BOTTOM of the role list (just before totals), not scattered in the middle.

**What Was Wrong:**
The generated SOW didn't include Account Manager at all, so this requirement couldn't be met.

**How It's Fixed:**
- Added section 8 (FORMATTING RULES): "CRITICAL ROLE ORDERING"
- Explicit instruction: "Account Manager hours MUST ALWAYS appear at the BOTTOM of the role list (just before TOTAL line)"
- Standard order established: Strategic/Tech roles first ‚Üí Delivery/Implementation ‚Üí Project Coordination ‚Üí Account Management (LAST)
- Applies to all SOW types: Standard Projects, Audits, and Retainers

**Code Location:**
```typescript
// frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts - Lines ~254-260

**CRITICAL ROLE ORDERING:**
- Account Manager hours MUST ALWAYS appear at the BOTTOM of the role list (just before TOTAL line)
- Standard order: Strategic/Tech roles first ‚Üí Delivery/Implementation ‚Üí Project Coordination ‚Üí Account Management (LAST)
- This applies to all SOW types: Standard Projects, Audits, and Retainers
```

### ‚úÖ **Requirement 3: Split Roles (Specialist/Producer) Not Just Senior**

**What Sam Required:**
> Production work must be split across specialist and producer roles, not allocated entirely to senior roles. This creates realistic team composition and better budget allocation.

**What Was Wrong:**
The generated SOW used high-level senior titles for production work:
- "Senior Business Analyst" (strategy)
- "Solutions Architect" (design)
- "Senior Front-End Developer" (development)
- "Senior QA Engineer" (testing)
- "Creative Director" (creative)

This is over-allocation to senior roles for routine execution work that should be handled by Producers and Specialists.

**How It's Fixed:**
- Added new section 2 (RATE CARD RULES): "ROLE ALLOCATION STRATEGY (SAM GOSSAGE METHOD)"
- Explicit guidance: "For production work, ALWAYS split across seniority levels"
- Example provided: "For HubSpot build: Architects (5-10 hrs) + Specialists (15-20 hrs) + Producers (30-40 hrs)"
- Added to section 9 validation: "ROLE ALLOCATION DISCIPLINE"
- Instruction: "Split production work across SPECIALIST and PRODUCER roles (NOT just Senior roles)"
- Message: "Minimize Senior/Head Of roles - use only for strategy, architecture, oversight (NOT routine execution)"

**Code Location:**
```typescript
// frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts - Lines ~206-215 (Rate Card section)

**ROLE ALLOCATION STRATEGY (SAM GOSSAGE METHOD):**
- For production work, ALWAYS split across seniority levels: Use mix of Producer/Specialist roles (lower cost) + Senior roles (oversight)
- AVOID allocating 100% senior hours to routine execution
- Example for HubSpot build: 
  * Architects/Consultants: Strategic design, integration architecture (5-10 hrs)
  * Specialists: Complex workflow setup, data validation (15-20 hrs)
  * Producers: Routine configuration, template build, testing (30-40 hrs)
- Result: Realistic team, correct budget tier, client confidence in execution quality
```

### ‚úÖ **Requirement 4: Round Totals to Nearest $5,000**

**What Sam Required:**
> Final investment totals should be rounded to clean numbers ($45k, $50k, $60k) not odd amounts ($47,310).

**What Was Wrong:**
The generated SOW totaled $13,310 (including GST) - an odd, non-rounded number that doesn't signal clean budgeting.

**How It's Fixed:**
- Added new guidance in section 4 (DOCUMENT BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS): "PRICING ROUNDING (SAM GOSSAGE REQUIREMENT)"
- Explicit rule: "Round final investment totals to nearest $5,000"
- Examples: "$45k, $50k, $55k, $60k - NOT $47,310"
- Why: "Clients expect clean numbers for budgeting and negotiations"
- Method: "Calculate exact total, then round up/down to nearest $5k. Adjust hours or roles slightly if needed to match rounded figure"
- Added to validation checklist: "‚úì **Total investment rounded to nearest $5,000**"

**Code Location:**
```typescript
// frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts - Lines ~218-230 (Budget Adjustments section)

**PRICING ROUNDING (SAM GOSSAGE REQUIREMENT):**
- Round final investment totals to nearest $5,000 (e.g., $45k, $50k, $55k, $60k - NOT $47,310)
- Why: Clients expect clean numbers for budgeting and negotiations
- Method: Calculate exact total, then round up/down to nearest $5k. Adjust hours or roles slightly if needed to match rounded figure
- Document rounding: "Investment rounded to $50k for budget alignment"
```

### ‚úÖ **Requirement 5: Include Discount Mechanism**

**What Sam Required:**
> SOWs should include an optional discount field (or discount calculation) for multi-phase or retainer engagements.

**What Was Wrong:**
The generated SOW included only "Subtotal" ‚Üí "GST (10%)" ‚Üí "TOTAL". No discount mechanism for volume/commitment discounts.

**How It's Fixed:**
- Added rounding section guidance: "Include optional discount field: 'Available discount for annual commitment: -10% = $45k/year'"
- Added to validation checklist: "Discount mechanism included if multi-phase or retainer (optional discount field for future negotiations)"
- Prompt now suggests showing discounts as negotiation leverage

**Code Location:**
```typescript
// frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts - Lines ~224-230 (Budget Adjustments section)

- Include optional discount field: "Available discount for annual commitment: -10% = $45k/year"

// And in validation checklist:
- ‚úì Discount mechanism included if multi-phase or retainer (optional discount field for future negotiations)
```

---

## Updated Validation Checklist

Every generated SOW must now pass THIS validation checklist:

```
‚úì Account Management present (bottom of table)
‚úì Project Coordination present
‚úì Head Of / Senior Management present
‚úì Every role in pricing table identified (standard or custom)
‚úì All hours in retainers add up to stated commitment
‚úì Rates match role seniority level
‚úì If ANY custom rate used, footnote explains why
‚úì Annual projections accurate (monthly √ó 12 for retainers)
‚úì Total investment rounded to nearest $5,000 (e.g., $45k, $50k, $60k - NOT $47,310)
‚úì Discount mechanism included if multi-phase or retainer (optional discount field for future negotiations)
```

## Key Insight for Future Development

The AI Architect prompt now encodes Sam's **business strategy for SOW generation**:

1. **Mandatory roles** ensure professional team structure
2. **Proper role ordering** (Account Mgmt at bottom) signals professionalism
3. **Role splitting** (Specialist/Producer mix) creates realistic, cost-efficient teams
4. **Rounded pricing** ($5k increments) reflects mature budgeting practices
5. **Discount mechanism** enables negotiation flexibility

These 5 requirements work together to generate SOWs that **clients actually want to sign** (Sam's core mission).
