# üéØ FINAL BUG FIX: AI Pricing Narrative Conflict - RESOLVED

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Severity:** CRITICAL (Data Integrity Issue)

---

## üìã Executive Summary

The final demonstration surfaced a subtle but critical bug: **The AI was generating its own financial calculations in the narrative that conflicted with the application's authoritative pricing table**. This created financially inconsistent documents where the AI's math didn't match our application's math.

**The Solution:** We've updated The Architect's system prompt with one final, non-negotiable rule: **DO NOT CALCULATE PRICING IN THE NARRATIVE**. The AI now focuses solely on generating the `suggestedRoles` JSON, and our application is the single source of truth for all financial calculations.

---

## üêõ The Bug

### What Happened
In the final video demonstration, the AI correctly calculated that an 8% discount was needed to hit the $33,000 +GST budget. However:

- **AI's Narrative:** "Pre-Discount: $36,650, Discount: 8%, Final: $33,700"
- **Application's Table:** "Subtotal: $41,510, Discount: $1,415.10, Final: $45,200"

The document contained **two different versions of financial truth**, making it unprofessional and unusable.

### Root Cause
The system prompt contained this conflicting instruction:

```
FIFTH - BUDGET ADHERENCE:
- Show: "Original Price: $X +GST", "Discount: Y%", "Final Price: "Z +GST".
```

This line **explicitly told the AI to write financial summaries in the narrative**, creating a conflict with our application's calculations.

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### Files Modified

1. **`/root/the11-dev/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`**
   - Updated `THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (Line ~348-365)
   - Updated `THE_ARCHITECT_V2_PROMPT` (Line ~348-365)

2. **`/root/the11-dev/run-llm.ts`**
   - Updated standalone architect prompt (Line ~52-70)

### What Changed

#### BEFORE ‚ùå
```typescript
FIFTH - BUDGET ADHERENCE:
- Respect specified target budgets. When a budget is provided, you MUST adjust the scope, roles, or hours to meet the target.
- Show: "Original Price: $X +GST", "Discount: Y%", "Final Price: "Z +GST".
```

#### AFTER ‚úÖ
```typescript
FIFTH - BUDGET ADHERENCE:
- Respect specified target budgets. When a budget is provided, you MUST adjust the scope, roles, or hours to meet the target by modifying the roles and hours in your suggestedRoles JSON output.
- If a discount is needed to meet the budget, include ONLY this simple line in the narrative: "**Discount:** X%" (where X is the discount percentage). The Smart Discount system will automatically apply it to the pricing table.
- DO NOT write "Original Price," "Discount Amount," or "Final Price" calculations in the narrative. The application calculates all financial totals.

CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT CALCULATE PRICING IN THE NARRATIVE

Your ONLY responsibility for pricing is to generate the list of roles and hours in the suggestedRoles JSON output at the end of your response.

You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from writing any sentences or bullet points in the main SOW narrative that mention specific dollar amounts, discounts, subtotals, or final prices. Do not create your own "RETAINER INVESTMENT STRUCTURE" or "BUDGET ANALYSIS" sections with financial calculations.

The application's code will generate the one and only pricing summary table. Your job is to focus exclusively on the project scope, deliverables, timeline, and strategy - and then provide the suggestedRoles JSON. The application handles all math.

This ensures the document has a single, authoritative source of financial truth.

## üéØ How It Works Now

### AI's Responsibilities
1. **Strategy & Scope:** Focus on deliverables, timeline, and project strategy
2. **Role Selection:** Choose appropriate roles from the rate card
3. **Hour Allocation:** Assign hours to each role in the `suggestedRoles` JSON
4. **Discount Signal (if needed):** Include a simple line: `**Discount:** 8%`

### Application's Responsibilities
1. **Calculate Subtotal:** Sum all roles √ó hours √ó rates from the JSON
2. **Apply Discount:** Use the Smart Discount system to apply the percentage
3. **Generate Pricing Table:** Display the one and only financial summary
4. **Show in PDF:** Export the authoritative pricing to the final document

### Result
**The AI and the application no longer compete for financial authority.** The AI proposes, the application calculates. Single source of truth. Zero conflicts.

## üß™ Testing Required

### Test Case 1: Budget-Constrained SOW
**Prompt:**
```
Generate an SFMC Retainer SOW with a strict budget of $33,000 +GST.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- AI narrative describes the scope and deliverables (NO dollar amounts)
- AI includes: `**Discount:** 8%` (or whatever percentage is needed)
- AI provides `suggestedRoles` JSON with roles and hours
- Application calculates the subtotal from the JSON
- Application applies the 8% discount
- Application shows final price of $33,000 +GST in the pricing table
- PDF contains ONE financial summary (the application's table)

**Success Criteria:**
‚úÖ No conflicting numbers in the document  
‚úÖ AI narrative is 100% focused on scope and strategy  
‚úÖ Pricing table is the only source of financial data  

### Test Case 2: No Budget, No Discount
**Prompt:**
```
Generate a standard HubSpot Implementation SOW.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- AI narrative describes the scope (NO dollar amounts)
- AI does NOT mention any discount
- AI provides `suggestedRoles` JSON
- Application calculates the total
- Application shows 0% discount
- PDF pricing table shows the full price

**Success Criteria:**
‚úÖ No financial narrative in the AI's text  
‚úÖ Pricing table displays correctly with 0% discount

## üéì Lessons Learned

### The Problem with Dual Authority
When both the AI and the application calculate pricing:
- The AI uses approximate math (rounding, estimation)
- The application uses precise math (exact rates from rate card)
- Small differences compound into major inconsistencies
- Documents become unprofessional and confusing

### The Solution: Single Source of Truth
By enforcing that **only the application calculates financial totals**, we guarantee:
- 100% accuracy (rate card is the authoritative source)
- 100% consistency (one calculation engine)
- Professional documents (no conflicting numbers)
- Simpler AI prompt (AI focuses on strategy, not math)
