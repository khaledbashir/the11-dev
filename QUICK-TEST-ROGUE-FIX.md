# URGENT: Test the Rogue Prompt Injection Fix NOW

**Status:** Fix committed and ready to test  
**Commit:** `c5c9e68`  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - This is the bug blocking new client workspaces

## The Problem (What Was Broken)

When you created workspace "ddddddd" and typed "yo", the AI:
1. Received: `"yo\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response MUST contain two parts..."`
2. Faced conflict: Simple greeting + requirement to generate SOW
3. Result: Tortured chain-of-thought + nonsense placeholder SOW

## The Fix (What Changed)

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
const isSowGenerationMode = !isDashboardMode;  // ‚ùå TRUE for ALL non-dashboard
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
const messageLength = lastUserMessage.trim().length;
const isSowGenerationMode = !isDashboardMode && messageLength > 50;  // ‚úÖ TRUE only for substantial messages
```

Now the contract is only applied to messages > 50 characters (likely project briefs), not greetings.

## Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Test 1: Greeting (should NOT have contract)
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Create new workspace or go to existing one
4. Type: `yo`
5. Look at console output

**Expected:**
```
üìä [Contract Check] Message length: 2, isSowGenerationMode: false, isDashboard: false
```

**Check AI response:**
- Should be: "Hey! How can I help with your SOW?"
- NOT: "I see a conflict between..." + placeholder SOW

### Test 2: Project Brief (should have contract)
1. Same workspace
2. Type: `I need a mobile app with iOS and Android support, real-time notifications, user authentication. Budget: $50k, timeline: 6 months.`
3. Look at console

**Expected:**
```
üìä [Contract Check] Message length: 165, isSowGenerationMode: true, isDashboard: false
```

**Check AI response:**
- Should be: Full markdown SOW + JSON with scopeItems
- Should NOT be: Simple answer without structure

### Test 3: Dashboard (should NEVER have contract)
1. Go to Master Dashboard
2. Type: `yo`
3. Look at console

**Expected:**
```
üìä [Contract Check] Message length: 2, isSowGenerationMode: false, isDashboard: true
```

**Check AI response:**
- Should be: Analytics/query response
- NOT: "I need to generate a SOW"

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ PASS Indicators
- Console shows `isSowGenerationMode: false` for short messages
- Console shows `isSowGenerationMode: true` for long messages
- Greeting responses are helpful, not conflicted
- AI doesn't show chain-of-thought reasoning for casual messages

### ‚ùå FAIL Indicators
- Console shows `isSowGenerationMode: true` for "yo"
- Greeting responses include placeholder SOW
- AI shows tortured reasoning about conflicts
- Short messages get contract suffix in network requests

## Network Inspection (Optional)

1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Type "yo" in editor
3. Find POST request to `stream-chat` or AnythingLLM
4. Click it, go to Request or Payload
5. Look for `messages` array
6. **Expected:** Message should be just `"yo"` (no contract suffix)
7. **NOT expected:** Message should not contain "MUST contain two parts"

## If Something is Wrong

**Console shows `isSowGenerationMode: true` for "yo"?**
- Code didn't get deployed properly
- Refresh page: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
- Clear cache: DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cache Storage ‚Üí Clear All
- Restart dev server: kill and run `./dev.sh` again

**AI still gives nonsense responses for greetings?**
- Check network request payload to verify contract isn't there
- Check AnythingLLM workspace - make sure it has correct system prompt
- Look at `/api/anythingllm/stream-chat` response for errors

**Works locally but not in production?**
- Verify code was pushed to GitHub
- Run `git log --oneline` to confirm commit `c5c9e68` is there
- Verify production deployment picked up latest code

## After Verification

1. ‚úÖ Test all 3 scenarios above
2. ‚úÖ Verify console logs show correct values
3. ‚úÖ Verify AI responses are appropriate (no placeholder SOWs)
4. ‚úÖ Report pass/fail status
5. If PASS: Ready for production! üöÄ
6. If FAIL: Debug with verification doc: `ROGUE-PROMPT-INJECTION-RE-FIX-VERIFIED.md`
