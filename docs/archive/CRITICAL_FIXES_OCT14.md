# ï¿½ï¿½ CRITICAL FIXES - October 14, 2025

## âœ… COMPLETED (Test These Now!)

### 1. **LOGO FIXED** âœ…
**Problem:** Logo was cut off/incomplete in PDF  
**Root Cause:** Wrong logo URL (404 error)  
**Solution:**  
- Copied correct logos from `/root/thespace11/`
- Logo Dark-Green.png (366x44 horizontal logo)
- Now in: `pdf-service/social-garden-logo-dark.png` and `frontend/public/social-garden-logo.png`
- **Result:** Full logo should now appear in PDF header

### 2. **TABLE COMMAND ADDED** âœ…  
**Problem:** Tables not showing in PDF exports  
**Root Cause:** NO TABLE COMMAND in slash menu! Users couldn't insert tables at all!  
**Solution:**  
- Added `/table` slash command
- Inserts 3x3 table with header row
- Search terms: table, grid, spreadsheet
- **Result:** Users can now type `/table` to insert tables!

### 3. **DIVIDER COMMAND ADDED** âœ…
**Bonus:** Added `/divider` command for horizontal rules (common in SOWs)
- Search terms: divider, horizontal rule, hr, line, separator

### 4. **PDF SERVICE DEBUG LOGGING** âœ…
- Added logging to verify HTML content received
- Confirmed: PDF service DOES receive tables correctly when sent
- Issue was missing UI command, not PDF rendering
