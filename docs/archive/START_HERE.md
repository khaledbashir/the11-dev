# 🚀 How to Run the App - START HERE!

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Everything is ready to go!

---

## ⚡ SUPER QUICK START (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /root/the11
./dev.sh
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3333**

---

## 📋 What Gets Started

When you run `./dev.sh`:

| Service | Port | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Frontend (Next.js) | 3333 | http://localhost:3333 ✨ |
| Backend (FastAPI) | 8000 | http://localhost:8000 |
| MySQL Database | 3306 | localhost:3306 (auto) |
| AnythingLLM | 443 | ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host |

---

## ✅ Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Frontend?
curl http://localhost:3333

# Backend?
curl http://localhost:8000/api/agents

# Database?
mysql -u sg_sow_user -p -e "SELECT * FROM folders;" socialgarden_sow
```

### 3. Created `dev.sh` Script
**ONE command to run everything!**
```bash
./dev.sh
```
- Starts frontend + backend
- Hot reload enabled
- No more rebuilds!
- Press Ctrl+C to stop

### 4. Updated README
Clean, simple, points to all docs

---

## 🎯 WHEN YOU `cd /root/the11/`:

**Read this first:**
```bash
cat README.md
```

**Then read the master guide:**
```bash
cat docs/MASTER_GUIDE.md
```

**Or just start coding:**
```bash
./dev.sh
```

---

## 📁 FOLDER CLARITY:

```
/root/the11/  ← YOUR REAL PROJECT! (use this!)
├── docs/           ← All guides
├── dev.sh          ← Run everything!
├── README.md       ← Start here
└── (your code)

/root/thespace11/  ← TEMP FOLDER (can delete!)
└── (just temp files, logos we copied)
```

---

## 🚀 YOUR NEW WORKFLOW:

```bash
# 1. Go to project
cd /root/the11

# 2. Start dev server (ONE command!)
./dev.sh

# 3. Code! Changes appear INSTANTLY!

# 4. Commit when done
git add -A
git commit -m "My changes"
git push

# 5. Stop (Ctrl+C)
```

**No more:**
- ❌ cd backend, cd frontend, cd eminem dvd
- ❌ docker-compose build (only for production!)
- ❌ Slow rebuilds every change
- ❌ Getting lost in folders

**Now:**
- ✅ ONE command: `./dev.sh`
- ✅ Hot reload works!
- ✅ Changes instant!
- ✅ All docs organized!

## 💡 KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER:

1. **Your project:** `/root/the11/` (not thespace11!)
2. **Start dev:** `./dev.sh` (not Docker!)
3. **Hot reload:** Works! No rebuilds!
4. **Docker:** Only for production deployment
5. **All docs:** In `docs/` folder
6. **Master guide:** Has EVERYTHING!

---

## 🎬 WHAT TO DO NOW:

### Option 1: Keep this conversation
Stay here, we can keep working!

### Option 2: Switch to the11
```bash
cd /root/the11
cat docs/MASTER_GUIDE.md  # Read this!
./dev.sh                   # Start coding!
```

You won't be lost because:
- ✅ `README.md` tells you what to do
- ✅ `docs/MASTER_GUIDE.md` has everything
- ✅ All guides organized in `docs/`
- ✅ `./dev.sh` runs everything

---

## 🔥 SUMMARY OF EVERYTHING:

**The Confusion:**
- You were in `/root/thespace11/` (wrong folder)
- We were using Docker for development (slow!)
- Docs were scattered everywhere
- No single command to run everything

**The Solution:**
- ✅ Clarified folders (the11 vs thespace11)
- ✅ Created `dev.sh` - ONE command!
- ✅ Organized all docs into `docs/`
- ✅ Created MASTER_GUIDE.md with everything
- ✅ Explained Dev vs Production properly

**What You Can Do Now:**
- Run everything: `./dev.sh`
- Hot reload works!
- Clone anywhere and run
- Switch VPS providers
- Deliver to clients
- Never get lost (docs organized!)

---

## 🎉 YOU'RE READY!

**Next time you work:**
1. `cd /root/the11`
2. `./dev.sh`
3. Code!

**Need help?**
- Read `docs/MASTER_GUIDE.md`
- All answers are there!
