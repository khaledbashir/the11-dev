# 🚀 AnythingLLM Integration - GAME CHANGER!

## 🎯 The Vision (BRILLIANT!)

**Every client gets their own AI-powered workspace that knows EVERYTHING about their SOW!**

### Why This is GENIUS:
1. **Client can ask questions**: "How many hours did we allocate for Instagram content?"
2. **AI answers instantly**: Pulls from embedded SOW document
3. **RAG-powered insights**: "What's our total investment?" "When do deliverables start?"
4. **Professional AF**: Clients feel like they have a personal AI consultant

## 🏗️ Architecture Decision

### Option A: One Workspace Per Client (RECOMMENDED ✅)
**Structure:**
```
AnythingLLM Instance
├── Client: Australian Gold Growers Federation (AGGF)
│   ├── Document: SOW - HubSpot Integration (Oct 2025)
│   ├── Document: SOW - Landing Pages Phase 2 (Nov 2025)
│   └── Chat Thread: Client can ask questions about ALL their SOWs
│
├── Client: Acme Corp
│   ├── Document: SOW - Website Redesign
│   └── Document: SOW - SEO Campaign
│
└── Client: Tech Startup XYZ
    └── Document: SOW - MVP Development
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Client sees ALL their SOWs in one place
- ✅ AI can answer questions across multiple projects
- ✅ Better organization: "Show me all deliverables across all projects"
- ✅ Scales beautifully: Add new SOWs to existing workspace
- ✅ Professional: One login per client

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to manage workspace slugs (easy fix)

### Option B: One Workspace Per SOW
**Structure:**
```
AnythingLLM Instance
├── Workspace: AGGF-HubSpot-Oct2025
├── Workspace: AGGF-Landing-Pages-Nov2025
├── Workspace: AcmeCorp-Website-Redesign
└── Workspace: TechStartup-MVP
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple: 1 SOW = 1 Workspace
- ✅ Isolated: Each project has its own chat

**Cons:**
- ❌ Client needs multiple links for multiple projects
- ❌ Can't ask questions across projects
- ❌ Messy: 100 clients × 5 SOWs = 500 workspaces

### 🏆 Winner: **Option A - One Workspace Per Client**

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (This Session - 1 hour)

#### 1. Add "Ask AI" Link in SOW Editor
```tsx
// In the top navigation
<Button onClick={() => window.open(anythingLLMUrl, '_blank')}>
  <Sparkles className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  Ask AI About This SOW
</Button>
```

#### 2. Create Workspace on SOW Creation
```typescript
// When user clicks "New Document"
async function createClientWorkspace(clientName: string) {
  const slug = clientName.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '-');
  
  const response = await fetch('https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host/api/v1/workspace/new', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer 0G0WTZ3-6ZX4D20-H35VBRG-9059WPA',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: clientName,
      slug: slug
    })
  });
  
  return slug;
}
```

#### 3. Auto-Embed SOW on Save
```typescript
// Every time SOW is saved/updated
async function embedSOWToAnythingLLM(sow: Document, workspaceSlug: string) {
  // Get HTML from editor
  const htmlContent = editorRef.current.getHTML();
  
  // Convert to text for better embedding
  const textContent = htmlToText(htmlContent);
  
  // Upload to AnythingLLM
  const response = await fetch('https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host/api/v1/document/raw-text', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer 0G0WTZ3-6ZX4D20-H35VBRG-9059WPA',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      textContent: textContent,
      metadata: {
        title: sow.title,
        source: 'Social Garden SOW Editor',
        docId: sow.id,
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    })
  });
  
  // Update workspace with new document
  await fetch(`https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host/api/v1/workspace/${workspaceSlug}/update`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer 0G0WTZ3-6ZX4D20-H35VBRG-9059WPA',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      adds: [response.data.documentId]
    })
  });
}
```

### Phase 2: Client Portal Integration (Next - 2 hours)

#### 1. Embedded Chat in Client Portal
```tsx
// In the client-facing SOW viewer
<div className="sow-viewer">
  {/* SOW Content */}
  <SOWContent />
  
  {/* Embedded AnythingLLM Chat */}
  <div className="ai-assistant">
    <h3>Have questions about this proposal?</h3>
    <iframe 
      src={`https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host/embed/${workspaceSlug}`}
      style={{ width: '100%', height: '600px', border: 'none' }}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 2. Smart Prompt Suggestions
```tsx
// Pre-populated questions clients can click
const suggestedQuestions = [
  "What's the total investment for this project?",
  "How many hours are allocated for social media management?",
  "When will deliverables be completed?",
  "Can you break down the pricing by role?",
  "What's included in the project scope?",
  "How does the payment schedule work?"
];
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 2)

#### 1. Auto-Sync on Document Changes
- Watch for editor changes
- Debounce updates (save after 5 seconds of no typing)
- Re-embed to AnythingLLM
- Notify client: "SOW updated, AI knowledge refreshed"

#### 2. Multi-Document Context
- Client asks: "Compare the deliverables between my HubSpot and Landing Pages projects"
- AI pulls from BOTH documents in the workspace
- Generates comparison table

#### 3. Proactive Insights
- AI analyzes all SOWs for a client
- Generates: "You have 150 hours of content creation across 3 projects"
- Suggests: "Consider a retainer package to save 15%"

## 📊 Database Strategy (SMART!)

### Why We DON'T Need MySQL Immediately:

**AnythingLLM IS the database!** 🤯

1. **Document Storage**: SOWs stored in AnythingLLM (vector DB)
2. **User Management**: AnythingLLM has auth built-in
3. **Workspace Management**: AnythingLLM handles it
4. **Chat History**: All stored in AnythingLLM

### What We Still Need LocalStorage For (Temporarily):
- Editor state (current doc, open tabs)
- UI preferences (sidebar collapsed, dark mode)
- Draft SOWs before they're "published" to client

### Migration Path:
```
Phase 1: LocalStorage + AnythingLLM (NOW)
  ├── LocalStorage: Editor state, drafts
  └── AnythingLLM: Published SOWs, embeddings, chat

Phase 2: MySQL + AnythingLLM (Week 2)
  ├── MySQL: SOW metadata, client info, audit trail
  └── AnythingLLM: Full-text search, RAG, chat

Phase 3: AnythingLLM as Primary (Month 2)
  └── Everything in AnythingLLM with MySQL for critical metadata only
```

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Flow

### Agency Side (Internal Editor)
```
1. User clicks "New Document"
   └── Prompt: "Enter client name" (e.g., "Australian Gold Growers Federation")
   
2. System creates:
   ├── Local document in editor
   └── Workspace in AnythingLLM: "australian-gold-growers-federation"
   
3. User edits SOW with pricing table, deliverables, etc.

4. User clicks "Save" or "Publish to Client"
   └── System embeds full SOW to AnythingLLM workspace
   
5. User clicks "Ask AI" button
   └── Opens AnythingLLM in new tab with workspace pre-selected
```

### Client Side (Portal)
```
1. Client receives link: clientportal.socialgarden.com.au/sow/abc123

2. Client sees beautiful SOW with pricing table

3. Client scrolls down to "Questions?" section
   └── Embedded AnythingLLM chat widget
   
4. Client types: "How many hours for Instagram content?"
   └── AI responds instantly with embedded knowledge
   
5. Client clicks "Accept SOW"
   └── Digital signature captured
   └── SOW marked as accepted in both systems
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Access

### API Key Management
```typescript
// Store in environment variables (never commit!)
ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY=0G0WTZ3-6ZX4D20-H35VBRG-9059WPA
ANYTHINGLLM_BASE_URL=https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host
```

### Client Access
```typescript
// Create embed with restricted access
const embed = await fetch('/api/v1/embed/new', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    workspaceId: workspaceSlug,
    maxChats: 100, // Limit abuse
    allowedDomains: ['clientportal.socialgarden.com.au'] // Lock to your domain
  })
});
```

## 📝 Prompt Templates for Workspaces

### System Prompt for Client Workspace:
```
You are a helpful AI assistant for Social Garden clients. You have access to all 
Statement of Work (SOW) documents for this client.

Your role:
- Answer questions about project scope, pricing, deliverables, and timelines
- Be professional and concise
- Always cite the specific SOW when answering
- If asked about something not in the SOWs, politely say you don't have that information

Example responses:
- "According to your HubSpot Integration SOW from October 2025, we've allocated 
  40 hours for landing page development at $150/hour, totaling $6,000."
- "Your project includes 3 deliverables: [list from SOW]"
- "The total investment across all your active projects is $45,230 AUD including GST."
```
