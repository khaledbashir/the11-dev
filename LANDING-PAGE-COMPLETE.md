## üö® IMPORTANT: What NOT to Touch

As requested, I **DID NOT** modify:
- ‚ùå Any pricing calculations in portal

- ‚ùå useMemo implementations
- ‚ùå Any existing number handling
- ‚ùå Core business logic

The landing page is **completely separate** - it won't affect your existing SOW generator functionality.

## üìß Next Steps

1. **Review the landing page:** http://localhost:5000/landing
2. **Adjust prices** in the services array as needed
3. **Tell me which features to add/remove** from the list
4. **Provide exact pricing** for any services marked as "TBD"
5. **Share brand assets** for full white labeling
6. **Test the interactive calculator** - try selecting different services

---

## ‚ú® Final Notes

The landing page is designed to:
- **Sell the platform** to Social Garden clients
- **Set realistic expectations** about development
- **Emphasize white label** opportunity
- **Show all features** (nothing hidden)
