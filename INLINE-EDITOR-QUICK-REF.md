# 🚀 QUICK REFERENCE - Inline Editor Fix

## What Was Fixed

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Toolbar appeared randomly | Now only appears when text is selected |
| Buggy highlighting | Separate state management fixed this |
| Confusing modes | Two completely distinct modes |
| Lost selection | Selection stored and preserved |

---

## The Two Modes

### 🎯 Mode 1: Selection (EDITING)
```
Highlight → Click "Ask AI" → Transform
```
- Shows quick actions
- Works on selected text only
- Replace or Insert result

### ✍️ Mode 2: Slash Command (GENERATING)
```
Type /ai → Describe → Generate
```
- No quick actions (free-form)
- Generates new content
- Insert or Replace result

---

## Architecture

```
SelectionToolbar (NEW)
├── Shows on text selection
└── One "Ask AI" button

FloatingAIBar (IMPROVED)
├── Selection mode (triggerSource='selection')
│   ├── Quick actions shown
│   ├── Operates on selection
│   └── Replace/Insert for selection
│
└── Slash mode (triggerSource='slash')
    ├── No quick actions
    ├── Free-form generation
    └── Insert/Replace for new content
```

---

## Key Changes

### New File
```
✨ selection-toolbar.tsx
   - Lightweight toolbar
   - Only on text selection
   - "Ask AI" button triggers full bar
```

### Modified File
```
📝 floating-ai-bar.tsx
   - Split visibility: showToolbar + isVisible
   - Clear mode tracking: triggerSource
   - Selection preservation: selectionRef
   - Import SelectionToolbar component
```

---

## State Flow

```
Text Selected
  ↓
showToolbar = true
showActions = false (no button click yet)
hasSelection = true

User Clicks "Ask AI"
  ↓
showToolbar = false
isVisible = true
triggerSource = 'selection'
showActions = true

User Types /ai
  ↓
showToolbar = false
isVisible = true
triggerSource = 'slash'
showActions = false
```

## Testing Quick Checklist

- [ ] Highlight text → Toolbar appears
- [ ] Click "Ask AI" → Full bar opens with actions
- [ ] Type /ai → Full bar opens without actions
- [ ] Quick action → Transforms text
- [ ] Custom prompt → Transforms/generates text
- [ ] Replace button → Works correctly
- [ ] Insert button → Works correctly
- [ ] ESC key → Closes bar
- [ ] Enter key → Generates text
- [ ] Deselect text → Toolbar disappears

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Toolbar doesn't appear**
- Select more text? Just clicking isn't enough
- Check if you're in the editor

**Q: /ai doesn't work**
- Type `/ai` exactly (with slash)
- Make sure you're in the editor
- Try again after Escape

**Q: Selection lost**
- It shouldn't be! It's stored in ref
- If lost, try selecting again

**Q: Results are weird**
- Click "Refine" to try again
- Try a different prompt
- Try a different model
