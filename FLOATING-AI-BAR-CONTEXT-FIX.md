# ✅ Floating AI Bar Context Fix - Complete

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: FIXED & DEPLOYED  
**Issue**: AI bar not showing when highlighting text or using slash commands

---

## 🐛 Root Cause

The `FloatingAIBar` component was using the `useEditor()` hook from Novel, but this hook only works in specific contexts within the editor tree. The component was placed after `EditorContent` closed, putting it outside the proper scope.

**Console Error Logs**:
```
⚠️ [FloatingAIBar] No editor available
🔍 [FloatingAIBar] Component mounted, editor: not available
⚠️ [FloatingAIBar] Waiting for editor to be ready... (repeated)
```

---

## ✅ Solution

### 1. **Moved FloatingAIBar Inside EditorContent**
- Placed the component inside `EditorContent` where it has proper context
- Now receives editor reference from parent component

### 2. **Added Editor Prop Support**
- Modified FloatingAIBar to accept editor as a prop
- Falls back to `useEditor()` hook if prop not provided
- Ensures compatibility with both direct usage and hook-based usage

```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
export function FloatingAIBar({ onGenerate }) {
  const { editor } = useEditor();  // ❌ Returns undefined
  // ...
}

// AFTER (Fixed)
export function FloatingAIBar({ onGenerate, editor: editorProp }) {
  const { editor: editorContext } = useEditor();
  const editor = editorProp || editorContext;  // ✅ Uses passed prop first
  // ...
}
```

### 3. **Updated Component Hierarchy**
```
<EditorRoot>
  <EditorContent>
    ... (content) ...
    <EditorBubble> ... </EditorBubble>
    <TableMenu />
    <FloatingAIBar editor={editor} />  ✅ NOW HERE
  </EditorContent>
</EditorRoot>
```

## 📁 Files Changed

1. **`/root/the11/frontend/components/tailwind/floating-ai-bar.tsx`**
   - Added `editor` prop to interface
   - Added import for `EditorInstance` from `novel`
   - Uses prop as fallback to `useEditor()` hook

2. **`/root/the11/frontend/components/tailwind/advanced-editor.tsx`**
   - Moved `<FloatingAIBar />` inside `EditorContent`
   - Pass `editor` prop: `<FloatingAIBar editor={editor} />`
   - Properly closed `EditorContent` tag

---

## 🧪 Expected Behavior

### ✅ Text Selection
1. User highlights any text in the editor
2. Floating AI bar appears at bottom with:
   - "SUGGESTIONS" section (Improve Writing button)
   - "QUICK ACTIONS" grid (8 action buttons)
   - Custom prompt input field

### ✅ Slash Command
1. User types `/` in the editor
2. Slash menu appears
3. First option is "Ask AI" with Sparkles icon
4. User clicks "Ask AI"
5. Floating AI bar appears with custom prompt field

### ✅ Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Enter` - Generate/Send
- `Escape` - Close AI bar
- `Shift+Enter` - Multiline input

---

## 🧬 Technical Details

### Why This Matters
- Novel Editor uses React Context for editor instances
- `useEditor()` hook only works within the provider scope
- Components outside this scope receive `undefined`
- Passing via props ensures proper component communication

### Fallback Pattern
```typescript
const editor = editorProp || editorContext || null;
```
This ensures:
1. Direct prop takes priority (when passed from parent)
2. Falls back to context hook (for flexibility)
3. Returns null if neither available (won't crash)
