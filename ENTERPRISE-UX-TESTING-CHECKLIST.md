## ÔøΩ CRITICAL ISSUE: 401 Unauthorized on Chat Endpoint

### Issue Details
**Error**: `/api/chat` returns 401 Unauthorized  
**When**: User tries to send a chat message  
**Root Cause**: Authentication token missing or expired  
**Severity**: BLOCKS all chat functionality

**Console Output**:
```
/api/chat:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()
page.tsx:2514 üì• Response Status: 401
```

### Diagnosis Needed
- [ ] Check `/frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts` for auth validation
- [ ] Verify auth token is being sent with request headers
- [ ] Check if session/cookie is set correctly
- [ ] Verify auth middleware is not too strict

### Next Steps
1. Find the `/api/chat` route handler
2. Check how it validates auth
3. Compare with working endpoints (like `/api/sow/create`)
4. Add token to request if missing OR relax auth if too strict
5. Test chat again

**Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - Waiting for fix

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem: 401 Unauthorized on /api/chat
**This is the current blocker**

Possible solutions:
1. Auth token not being sent ‚Üí Add token to request headers
2. Session expired ‚Üí Refresh session before chat
3. Auth middleware too strict ‚Üí Modify middleware to allow chat requests
4. CORS issue ‚Üí Check CORS headers
5. Missing auth provider ‚Üí Ensure auth is initialized

**Files to check**:
- `/frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts` (main handler)
- `/frontend/lib/anythingllm.ts` (request builder)
- `/frontend/app/page.tsx` (where chat is called)

### Problem: Dashboard Shows But Then Switches Away
**Solution**: This means auto-selection is working! Check:
- Console logs show: `ü§ñ [Auto-Select] Editor mode`
- This is correct behavior if you had SOWs in a workspace
- New users won't see this (dashboard stays if no workspaces)

### Problem: 400 Errors Still in Console
**Solution**: Check the exact error message:
- If it says "Creating thread on-demand" ‚Üí Good, working as designed
- If it says "Failed (attempt 5/5): 400" ‚Üí Thread creation failing, DM me logs

### Problem: Workspace Creation Modal Doesn't Appear
**Solution**:
- Refresh the page
- Try creating another workspace
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- If still broken, share console output

### Problem: Onboarding Doesn't Appear
**Solution**:
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Refresh page
- If still no onboarding, check console for errors
- Onboarding only shows when there are ZERO workspaces

### Problem: Chat Doesn't Send
**Solution**:
- Check console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
- Verify thread was created (look for console logs)
- If 400 error, wait 5 seconds and try again
- Share console output if stuck
