# ✅ FIXED: Sidebar Icons Now Always Visible

## Problem
Hover icons (rename, delete) were disappearing after workspaces loaded. User could see them initially but then lost them.

## Root Cause
Icons had `opacity-0` which made them completely invisible when not hovering. This made it hard to know where to hover, especially with many workspaces.

## Solution Applied ✅

Changed opacity from `0` to `30` so icons are:
- **Always slightly visible** (`opacity-30`) - you can see where they are
- **Fully visible on hover** (`opacity-100`) - clear when you interact
- **Smooth transition** - nice fade effect

### Files Modified
- `/frontend/components/tailwind/sidebar-nav.tsx`

### Changes:

**Workspace actions (line 264):**
```tsx
// BEFORE:
<div className="flex gap-1 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 ...">

// AFTER:
<div className="flex gap-1 opacity-30 group-hover:opacity-100 ...">
```

**SOW actions (line 379):**
```tsx
// BEFORE:
<div className="flex gap-1 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 ...">

// AFTER:
<div className="flex gap-1 opacity-30 group-hover:opacity-100 ...">
```

**Also added:**
- `e.stopPropagation()` to all action buttons to prevent conflicts

## What You'll See Now ✅

### Workspace Row:
```
📁 Client Name    [dimmed + icon] [dimmed ✏️] [dimmed 🗑️]
                      ↓ ON HOVER ↓
📁 Client Name    [bright + icon] [bright ✏️] [bright 🗑️]
```

### SOW Row:
```
   📄 SOW Title    [dimmed ✏️] [dimmed 🗑️]
                      ↓ ON HOVER ↓
   📄 SOW Title    [bright ✏️] [bright 🗑️]
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Icons always visible** - No guessing where to hover
2. ✅ **Clear affordance** - Users know actions are available
3. ✅ **Smooth UX** - Nice fade effect on hover
4. ✅ **No layout shift** - Icons don't pop in/out
5. ✅ **Better accessibility** - Easier to find controls

## Testing

1. Open your app
2. Look at sidebar workspaces
3. **You should now see dimmed icons** even without hovering ✅
4. Hover over workspace - icons become fully bright ✅
5. Click any icon - it works! ✅

## Quick Comparison

| State | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Not hovering | 🚫 Invisible (opacity: 0) | ✅ Dimmed (opacity: 30%) |
| Hovering | ✅ Visible (opacity: 100%) | ✅ Bright (opacity: 100%) |
| Click works? | ⚠️ Yes but hard to find | ✅ Yes and easy to find |

## If You Want Them Fully Hidden Again

Change `opacity-30` back to `opacity-0` in both places:
- Line 264: Workspace actions container
- Line 379: SOW actions container

But the current approach (opacity-30) is better UX! 🎯
