## Summary of Changes

This implementation addresses all 7 critical requirements identified from Sam's analysis of the sow.qandu.me system vs. the PDF exports. All changes ensure that AI-generated SOWs, the web UI, and PDF exports are now fully aligned with business requirements.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. GST Display Per Line Item (FIXED)

**Requirement:** Show "+GST" on EVERY line item in pricing tables, not just a single GST line at bottom.

**Implementation:**

### AI Prompt Updates (`frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`):
- Updated pricing table example to show `AUD 2,950 +GST` format for each line item
- Added explicit rule: **"GST DISPLAY: Show '+GST' on EVERY line item's total, not just at bottom"**
- Updated validation checklist to enforce this requirement

### Frontend UI Updates (`frontend/components/tailwind/extensions/editable-pricing-table.tsx`):
- Line item display: Changed from `$${(row.hours * row.rate).toFixed(2)}` to `AUD ${(row.hours * row.rate).toFixed(2)} +GST`
- Summary totals: All currency displays updated to include "+GST" suffix
- renderHTML function: Updated to generate `AUD ${rowTotal.toFixed(2)} +GST` in exported HTML

**Result:** Every pricing line item now displays with "+GST" suffix consistently across AI generation, web UI, and PDF exports.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. AUD Currency (FIXED)

**Requirement:** All prices must use "AUD" prefix (e.g., "AUD 3,200.00") instead of generic "$" symbol.

**Implementation:**

### AI Prompt Updates (`frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`):
- Updated all pricing examples to use `AUD 295` format instead of `$295`
- Added explicit rule: **"CURRENCY: Always use 'AUD' prefix for all dollar amounts"**
- Updated rate card examples and table headers to use AUD format
- Added validation checkpoint: "Currency: ALL prices use 'AUD' prefix"

### Frontend Components Updated:

1. **`editable-pricing-table.tsx`** (Primary pricing table component):
   - Role dropdown: `{role.name} - AUD {role.rate}/hr`
   - Line item totals: `AUD {(row.hours * row.rate).toFixed(2)} +GST`
   - Subtotal display: `AUD {calculateSubtotal().toFixed(2)}`
   - Discount display: `-AUD {calculateDiscount().toFixed(2)}`
   - Total display: `AUD {calculateSubtotalAfterDiscount().toFixed(2)} +GST`
   - GST breakdown: `AUD {calculateGST().toFixed(2)}`
   - renderHTML function: Updated to generate `AUD ${row.rate.toFixed(2)}` in PDF output

2. **`send-to-client-modal.tsx`** (Email/portal send preview):
   - Changed: `<strong>Investment:</strong> AUD {document.totalInvestment.toLocaleString("en-AU", { minimumFractionDigits: 2 })}`

3. **`sow-calculator.tsx`** (Manual SOW builder):
   - Header: `**Total Investment:** AUD ${total.toLocaleString('en-AU', { minimumFractionDigits: 2 })} +GST`
   - Pricing table: All columns use `AUD ${amount}` format
   - Summary table: `AUD ${subtotal}`, `-AUD ${discountAmount}`, `AUD ${total} +GST`

**Result:** All currency displays system-wide now use "AUD" prefix consistently.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Document Structure Reordering (FIXED)

**Requirement:** "Detailed Deliverable Groups" section must appear IMMEDIATELY after "Overview", not after "Project Phases".

**Implementation:**

### AI Prompt Updates (`frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`):

**Old Order:**
1. Headline
2. Overview
3. What's Included
4. Project Outcomes
5. Scope Assumptions
6. Detailed Deliverable Groups ‚Üê Was after assumptions
7. Project Phases

**New Order:**
1. Headline
2. Overview
3. **Detailed Deliverable Groups** ‚Üê NOW appears immediately after Overview
4. What's Included
5. Project Outcomes
6. Scope Assumptions
7. Project Phases

**Changes Made:**
- Updated section 3 to be "Detailed Deliverable Groups" with critical marking
- Added checkpoint: "Can you see '## Detailed Deliverable Groups' as section heading appearing BEFORE 'What's Included'?"
- Updated all SOW format templates (Standard Project, Audit/Strategy, Retainer) to reflect new order
- Added enforcement rule: If section order is wrong, STOP and regenerate

**Result:** All AI-generated SOWs now place detailed deliverables immediately after overview, matching Sam's requirements.

## ‚úÖ 4. Mandatory "Head Of" Role (FIXED)

**Requirement:** Every SOW MUST include a mandatory senior oversight role (e.g., "Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management") with minimum hours.

**Implementation:**

### AI Prompt Updates (`frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`):

**Enhanced Mandatory Team Composition Section:**
```
üö® EVERY scope MUST include these THREE roles in pricing table - NO EXCEPTIONS:
1. **Senior Oversight Role** (Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management or equivalent "Head Of" role) 
   - MINIMUM 2-4 hours (strategic oversight only, NOT execution)
2. **Project Coordination** (Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination) 
   - 3-10 hours minimum (project management, status updates)
3. **Account Management** (Senior Account Manager or Account Manager) 
   - 6-12 hours minimum (client liaison, stakeholder management)

‚ö†Ô∏è VALIDATION CHECKPOINT: Before finalizing pricing table, verify all three roles are present. 
If ANY role is missing, ADD IT NOW.
```

**Added Explicit Reasoning:**
- Senior Oversight: Strategic direction and quality assurance
- Project Coordination: Day-to-day project management and delivery tracking
- Account Management: Client relationship and communication

**Validation Updates:**
- Updated pricing validation checklist to require: "Tech-Head Of - Senior Project Management present (2-4 hours for strategic oversight)"
- Changed from 5-15 hours to 2-4 hours minimum (more realistic for oversight-only role)
- Added enforcement: "If these three roles are NOT present, the SOW is INCOMPLETE and INVALID and will be REJECTED"

**Result:** AI now automatically includes senior oversight role in every SOW with appropriate minimal hours.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Pricing Rounding (FIXED)

**Requirement:** Round final investment totals to nearest AUD 5,000 (e.g., AUD 45,000, AUD 50,000, AUD 55,000 - NOT AUD 47,310).

**Implementation:**

### AI Prompt Updates (`frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`):

**Enhanced Pricing Rounding Section:**
```
**PRICING ROUNDING (SAM GOSSAGE REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL):**
- **MANDATORY: Round final investment totals to nearest AUD 5,000 (e.g., AUD 45,000, AUD 50,000, AUD 55,000 - NOT AUD 47,310)**
- Why: Clients expect clean numbers for budgeting and negotiations
- Method: Calculate exact total, then round up/down to nearest AUD 5,000. Adjust hours or roles slightly if needed to match rounded figure
- Document rounding in a note: "Note: Investment rounded to AUD 50,000 for budget alignment"
- Include optional discount field when applicable: "Available discount for annual commitment: -10% = AUD 45,000/year"
- **This is NOT optional - every SOW total MUST be a clean round number**
```

**Validation Updates:**
- Added to pricing validation checklist: "‚úì **Rounding: Total investment rounded to nearest AUD 5,000**"
- Added to final validation: "‚úì **Confirmation: Final total is rounded to nearest AUD 5,000 (e.g., AUD 50,000 not AUD 47,310)**"

**Result:** AI now generates SOWs with clean, rounded totals that match client budgeting expectations.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Discount Presentation (ALREADY CORRECT)

**Requirement:** Clear discount presentation with subtotal, discount amount, and grand total.

**Status:** The system already handles this correctly via the editable pricing table component.

**Existing Implementation:**
- Discount field in pricing table UI
- Automatic calculation: `Subtotal ‚Üí Discount ‚Üí Subtotal After Discount ‚Üí GST ‚Üí Total`
- Display format: Shows percentage and dollar amount for discounts
- All now using AUD currency format

**No changes required** - discount functionality is working as designed.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Default Currency to AUD System-Wide (FIXED)

**Requirement:** Set AUD as the default currency across all system components.

**Implementation:** Comprehensive update across all components (see #2 above for complete details).

**Files Updated:**
- `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` - AI prompt and examples
- `frontend/components/tailwind/extensions/editable-pricing-table.tsx` - Main pricing table
- `frontend/components/tailwind/send-to-client-modal.tsx` - Email preview
- `frontend/components/tailwind/sow-calculator.tsx` - Manual calculator

**Result:** Every pricing display, calculation, and export now uses AUD as the base currency.

## Technical Architecture Notes

### How the System Works (For Future Reference)

**AI Generation Flow:**
1. User provides brief ‚Üí AI (The Architect) generates SOW using `THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
2. AI output is in Markdown format with pricing tables
3. Frontend converts Markdown to TipTap JSON structure
4. TipTap JSON can be edited in the rich text editor

**PDF Export Flow:**
1. Frontend converts TipTap JSON to HTML using `generateHTML(content, defaultExtensions)`
2. HTML is sent to backend `/generate-pdf` endpoint
3. Backend uses Jinja2 template + WeasyPrint to render PDF
4. PDF inherits styling from `DEFAULT_CSS` constant in `backend/main.py`

**Key Insight:** The pricing table formatting comes from the AI's markdown output, which is then converted to HTML. Therefore, fixing the AI prompt fixes both the web UI and PDF exports.

   - Verify "AUD" prefix appears consistently
   - Export to PDF and verify AUD currency in PDF

3. **Test Document Structure:**
   - Generate new SOW
   - Verify "Detailed Deliverable Groups" appears after Overview
   - Verify "Project Phases" appears later in document

4. **Test Mandatory Roles:**
   - Generate SOWs with different prompts/budgets
   - Verify all three mandatory roles present:
     * Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management (2-4 hours)
     * Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination (3-10 hours)
     * Account Management (6-12 hours)

5. **Test Rounding:**
   - Generate SOWs with various budgets
   - Verify totals are rounded to nearest AUD 5,000
   - Example: AUD 47,000 becomes AUD 45,000 or AUD 50,000
