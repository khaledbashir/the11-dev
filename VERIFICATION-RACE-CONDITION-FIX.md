# Quick Verification: Agent Selection Race Condition Fix

**Commit:** `996fefd`  
**Date:** October 23, 2025

## What Changed

‚úÖ Split agent selection into two sequential useEffects  
‚úÖ Removed hardcoded 'gen-the-architect' default that happened too early  
‚úÖ Made agent selection dependent on viewMode and context  

## How to Verify the Fix Works

### Method 1: Browser Console Logs (Immediate)

1. **Open VS Code** and run `./dev.sh` to start the app locally
2. **Open browser DevTools** (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
3. **Refresh the page** or **navigate to Master Dashboard**
4. **Look for these logs in this order:**

```
‚úÖ Loaded 8 Gardners: Array(8)  // ‚Üê Agents loaded
üéØ [Agent Selection] In DASHBOARD mode - agent managed by dashboard component  // ‚Üê Agent selection happens AFTER
```

‚úÖ **GOOD** - Agent selection happens AFTER recognizing dashboard mode  
‚ùå **BAD** - If you see `Default agent set to: gen-the-architect` before or instead

### Method 2: Chat Response Type (Functional Test)

1. **Load Master Dashboard** (ensure you're in dashboard mode)
2. **Open chat** and type: `Hi`
3. **Check the response:**

‚úÖ **CORRECT** Response: Analytics/summary focused
- "I have access to all SOWs in the database"
- "I can help you analyze..." 
- "What would you like to know about..."

‚ùå **INCORRECT** Response: Generation/Architect focused
- "I can help create a new SOW"
- "Let me generate a feature list"
- "Here's a proposal structure..."

### Method 3: Network Inspection (API Level)

1. **Open DevTools** ‚Üí Network tab
2. **Filter by:** `stream-chat` or `/api/`
3. **Open Master Dashboard and type a message**
4. **Click on the POST request to `/api/anythingllm/stream-chat`**
5. **Check the Request Payload (Request tab):**

Look for:
```json
{
  "workspace": "sow-master-dashboard",
  "mode": "query",
  "model": "sow-master-dashboard",
  ...
}
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT** - workspace and model are BOTH "sow-master-dashboard"  
‚ùå **INCORRECT** - If model is something like "gen-the-architect"

### Method 4: Server-Side Debug Logs (Most Detailed)

The debug logging added earlier is still in place. Check terminal where backend is running:

```
‚úÖ Request to /api/anythingllm/stream-chat
   Workspace: sow-master-dashboard
   Mode: query
   Model: sow-master-dashboard
```

## Expected Timeline After Fix

```
T0: Page loads
T1: useEffect #1 [] runs ‚Üí agents fetch
    Log: "üå± Loading Gardners from AnythingLLM..."
T2: Agents load
    Log: "‚úÖ Loaded 8 Gardners: Array(8)"
T3: useEffect #2 [agents, viewMode, ...] runs
T4: viewMode detected = 'dashboard'
    Log: "üéØ [Agent Selection] In DASHBOARD mode - agent managed by dashboard component"
T5: Dashboard ready, uses master-dashboard workspace
```

## What if it's not working?

### Still seeing "Default agent set to: gen-the-architect"?
- **Issue:** Code didn't get deployed properly
- **Fix:** 
  1. Check that `frontend/app/page.tsx` lines 990-1063 have the two separate useEffects
  2. Run `cd frontend && pnpm build` to verify compilation
  3. Restart dev server with `./dev.sh`

### Master Dashboard still giving Architect responses?
- **Issue:** Agent selection fixed but Dashboard might still be in wrong mode
- **Fix:**
  1. Check Network tab - verify `mode: 'query'` in payload
  2. Check AnythingLLM workspace config - verify it has Analytics prompt (not Architect)
  3. See debug logging from Phase 3 in `/api/anythingllm/stream-chat/route.ts`

### Different console logs than expected?
- **Issue:** May be seeing logs from cache
- **Fix:**
  1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
  2. Clear browser cache: DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Clear
  3. Restart dev server completely: Kill all terminals, run `./dev.sh` fresh

## Detailed Verification Checklist

- [ ] Console shows agents loading
- [ ] Console shows agent selection in dashboard mode (not early default)
- [ ] Type "Hi" in Master Dashboard gets analytics response
- [ ] Network shows model="sow-master-dashboard" for dashboard requests
- [ ] Type "Hi" in Editor (SOW) gets Architect response
- [ ] Network shows model="gen-the-architect" or similar for editor requests

## If All Checks Pass

‚úÖ **Race condition is FIXED!**

Next step: Clean up debug logging from `/api/anythingllm/stream-chat/route.ts` (keep for now, use later if issues arise)
