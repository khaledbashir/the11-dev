# üîß SOW GENERATION CONTENT FIX - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Issues:** Non-client-facing headers + blank space after pricing table

---

## üö® **PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED**

### Problem 1: Internal Headers Leaking to Client
**What was showing:**
```
## PART 1: REASONING SUMMARY

I've classified this as a Standard Project requiring a phased delivery 
approach. With the firm $20,000 budget constraint, I strategically 
allocated the mandatory governance roles...

## PART 2: THE FINAL SCOPE OF WORK

**PROJECT:** HubSpot CRM Integration & Landing Page Development
```

**What SHOULD show:**
```
**PROJECT:** HubSpot CRM Integration & Landing Page Development
(Clean, client-facing only)
```

### Problem 2: Blank Space When Toggling AI Content
When toggling AI-generated content back on, the `[editablePricingTable]` placeholder was leaving whitespace instead of rendering the interactive table.

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED**

### Fix 1: Enhanced Content Sanitization
**File:** `/frontend/lib/export-utils.ts`

Added regex patterns to strip internal PART headers:

```typescript
// üö® CRITICAL: Remove internal PART headers (non-client-facing structure markers)
.replace(/^##\s*PART\s*\d+:\s*REASONING\s+SUMMARY[\s\S]*?(?=^##\s*PART\s*\d+:|^#{1,6}\s+[^#]|\*\*PROJECT)/mi, '')
.replace(/^##\s*PART\s*\d+:\s*THE\s+FINAL\s+SCOPE\s+OF\s+WORK\s*$/mi, '')
// Remove any standalone "## PART 1:" or "## PART 2:" headers
.replace(/^##\s*PART\s*\d+:.*$/gmi, '')
```

**What it does:**
- Strips `## PART 1: REASONING SUMMARY` and all content until the next major section
- Strips `## PART 2: THE FINAL SCOPE OF WORK` header
- Removes any leftover `## PART X:` headers

### Fix 2: Updated Architect Prompt
**File:** `/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`

Added explicit instruction to NOT include PART headers:

```typescript
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do NOT include "## PART 1:" or "## PART 2:" headers in your 
response. The client should NEVER see these internal structure markers.

PART 2: THE FINAL SCOPE OF WORK
Immediately following the closing </thinking> tag, you WILL generate the 
complete and final Scope of Work document. Start DIRECTLY with the PROJECT 
line (e.g., **PROJECT:** HubSpot CRM Integration). Do NOT include a 
"## PART 2: THE FINAL SCOPE OF WORK" header.
```

**Belt-and-suspenders approach:** The AI is told not to generate them, and if it does, the sanitizer strips them.

### Fix 3: Added Placeholder Detection
**File:** `/frontend/app/page.tsx`

Added handling for `[editablePricingTable]` placeholder:

```typescript
// Check for explicit pricing table placeholder
if (line.trim() === '[pricing_table]' || line.trim() === '[editablePricingTable]') {
  insertPricingTable();
  i++;
  continue;
}
```

**What it does:**
- Recognizes both `[pricing_table]` and `[editablePricingTable]` as pricing table markers
- Converts them to the interactive `editablePricingTable` React component
- No more blank spaces left behind

## üìä **BEFORE & AFTER**

### BEFORE: Client Sees Internal Process
```markdown
## PART 1: REASONING SUMMARY

I've classified this as a Standard Project requiring a phased delivery
approach. With the firm $20,000 budget constraint, I strategically
allocated the mandatory governance roles (5 hrs Tech Head, minimal
Project Coordination, and minimum Account Management) while preserving
sufficient hours for technical execution. The pricing calculation
resulted in $20,001, requiring a minimal 0.005% discount to achieve
the exact $20,000 target.

The role distribution balances high-value technical leadership with
efficient coordination, ensuring project success within budget while
maintaining quality delivery standards.

## PART 2: THE FINAL SCOPE OF WORK

**PROJECT:** HubSpot CRM Integration & Landing Page Development

**PROJECT TYPE:** Standard Project

**OBJECTIVE:** Complete HubSpot CRM integration with three
conversion-optimized landing pages...
```

### AFTER: Client Sees Clean, Professional SOW
```markdown
**PROJECT:** HubSpot CRM Integration & Landing Page Development

**PROJECT TYPE:** Standard Project

**OBJECTIVE:** Complete HubSpot CRM integration with three
conversion-optimized landing pages, including automation workflows,
progressive profiling, and comprehensive analytics tracking.

### SCOPE OF WORK

**Phase 1 ‚Äì HubSpot CRM Foundation Setup**

- HubSpot instance configuration and customization
- Contact database architecture and segmentation setup
...
```

## üß™ **HOW TO TEST**

### Test 1: Generate New SOW
1. Create a new SOW workspace
2. Send prompt: `"HubSpot integration and 3 landing pages, $20k budget"`
3. Wait for AI to generate
4. Click "Insert into editor"

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ NO `## PART 1:` or `## PART 2:` headers visible
- ‚úÖ Starts directly with `**PROJECT:**`
- ‚úÖ Internal reasoning is hidden (in `<thinking>` tags, stripped by sanitizer)

### Test 2: Pricing Table Rendering
1. After insertion, scroll to the pricing section
2. Verify the interactive table appears (drag-drop roles, edit hours)

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ NO blank space where `[editablePricingTable]` was
- ‚úÖ Interactive pricing table renders properly
- ‚úÖ Can drag roles, edit hours, see totals recalculate

### Test 3: Toggle AI Content Off/On
1. Generate SOW and insert
2. Toggle AI content OFF (should hide the generated content)
3. Toggle AI content back ON

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Pricing table reappears without blank space
- ‚úÖ All sections render correctly

---

## üìÅ **FILES MODIFIED**

1. ‚úÖ `/frontend/lib/export-utils.ts` - Enhanced `cleanSOWContent()` function
2. ‚úÖ `/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` - Updated Architect prompt with explicit warnings
3. ‚úÖ `/frontend/app/page.tsx` - Added `[editablePricingTable]` placeholder detection

---

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### Why Were PART Headers Showing?

The Architect system prompt has always included these headers as **internal structure guidance** for the AI to organize its response:

```
PART 1: INTERNAL STRATEGY MONOLOGUE (wrapped in <thinking> tags)
PART 2: THE FINAL SCOPE OF WORK (client-facing content)
```

**Problem:** The AI was interpreting these as **literal markdown headers** to include in the output, instead of internal instructions.

**Fix:** 
- Made it explicit: "Do NOT include these as headers"
- Added sanitization as a safety net

### Why Was There Blank Space?

The AI was generating `[editablePricingTable]` as a placeholder (likely learned from seeing examples), but the converter only recognized `[pricing_table]`.

**Fix:** Added detection for both placeholder formats.
