## 🎯 What Happened Last Session

### ✅ COMPLETED (Major Features):
- ✅ PDF export fixed (pricing table rendering)
- ✅ Sidebar rename/delete buttons (hover animation)
- ✅ AnythingLLM integration service (`lib/anythingllm.ts`)
- ✅ Social Garden knowledge base auto-injection
- ✅ Client portal (`/portal/sow/[id]`) with AI chat widget
- ✅ Workflow integration (Back to AI Hub, Share Portal)
- ✅ CSV export removed (kept Excel)

### 🎯 CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH:
User had a **brilliant idea**: 
> "Why don't we treat each folder as a workspace and each SOW as a thread?"

**Answer:** YES! This changes everything! 🚀

**Current architecture:** Folders=localStorage, SOWs=localStorage + manual embed  
**Future architecture:** Folders=Workspaces, SOWs=Threads (API-native)

**Status:** Fully planned, NOT implemented yet

---

## 🚨 Your Immediate Tasks

### Priority 1: Quick Fixes (30 min)
1. Add `postcss-import` to package.json:
   ```bash
   cd /root/the11/novel-editor-demo/apps/web
   pnpm add -D postcss-import
   ```

2. Remove Vercel Analytics (causing 404s):
   ```bash
   pnpm remove @vercel/analytics
   # Then remove from app/providers.tsx
   ```

3. Fix duplicate underline extension warning in `components/tailwind/extensions.ts`

### Priority 2: Architecture Migration (16 hours)
Follow **ARCHITECTURE-MIGRATION-PLAN.md** step by step:

**Phase 1: Thread API Integration (2 hours)**
- Add thread methods to `lib/anythingllm.ts`:
  - `createThread(workspaceSlug, name)`
  - `deleteThread(workspaceSlug, threadSlug)`
  - `updateThread(workspaceSlug, threadSlug, name)`
  - `getThreadChats(workspaceSlug, threadSlug)`
  - `chatWithThread(workspaceSlug, threadSlug, message)`

**Phase 2-8:** Follow the detailed plan in the migration doc
