# Resource Optimization Task Plan

## Current Resource Usage Analysis
- **npm**: 42.1% CPU usage - CRITICAL
- **VS Code server**: 10% CPU usage
- **ClickHouse server**: 2% CPU usage  
- **Docker daemon**: 1.5% CPU usage
- **PM2**: 1% CPU usage

## Task Steps

### Phase 1: Investigation & Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] 1.1 Investigate current running processes and their resource consumption
- [ ] 1.2 Identify what npm processes are running and consuming 42.1% CPU
- [ ] 1.3 Check for background npm tasks, builds, or package installations
- [ ] 1.4 Analyze other high CPU processes (VS Code server, ClickHouse, etc.)
- [ ] 1.5 Review system logs for any resource-intensive operations

### Phase 2: Process Management & Cleanup
- [ ] 2.1 Identify and terminate unnecessary npm processes
- [ ] 2.2 Clean up any stuck or hung package management operations
- [ ] 2.3 Optimize VS Code server usage if excessive
- [ ] 2.4 Review and optimize ClickHouse server configuration
- [ ] 2.5 Assess Docker daemon resource usage patterns

### Phase 3: System Optimization
- [ ] 3.1 Configure proper resource limits for development processes
- [ ] 3.2 Implement monitoring to prevent future resource spikes
- [ ] 3.3 Optimize npm/package management configurations
- [ ] 3.4 Review and optimize service startup configurations

### Phase 4: Verification & Monitoring
- [ ] 4.1 Monitor system performance after optimizations
- [ ] 4.2 Verify npm CPU usage has normalized
- [ ] 4.3 Test that essential services remain functional
- [ ] 4.4 Remove any temporary resource limitations if appropriate
- [ ] 4.5 Document the optimization changes made

### Phase 5: Long-term Solutions
- [ ] 5.1 Implement process monitoring and alerting
- [ ] 5.2 Create automation to prevent resource spikes
- [ ] 5.3 Document best practices for resource management
- [ ] 5.4 Set up periodic resource usage reviews

## Expected Timeline: 1-3 hours
## Priority: HIGH - npm 42.1% CPU usage requires immediate attention
