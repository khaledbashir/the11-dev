## 💬 Welcome Message Text

```
Welcome to the Master SOW Analytics assistant. I have access to 
all embedded SOWs. 

Ask me questions to get business insights, such as:
• "What is our total revenue from HubSpot projects?"
• "Which services were included in the RealEstateTT SOW?"
• "How many SOWs did we create this month?"
• "What's the breakdown of services across all clients?"

**Important:** I can only analyze and query existing SOWs. 
I cannot create new SOWs. For SOW generation, use the Editor 
mode with The Architect agent.
```
