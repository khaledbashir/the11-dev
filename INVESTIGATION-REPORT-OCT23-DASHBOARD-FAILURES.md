# Investigation Report: SOW Dashboard Critical Failures
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETE - Root Causes Identified  
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL (Three systemic failures affecting all dashboard metrics)

---

## Executive Summary

The dashboard is experiencing **three distinct but interconnected failures** stemming from backend query logic and missing data initialization:

| Issue | Root Cause | Impact | Severity |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **BI Widgets Empty** | Query filters out ALL SOWs (`status != 'draft'` when all SOWs are draft) | Pipeline by Vertical/Service shows "No data yet" | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| **Financial Data $0** | `total_investment` field never populated on SOW creation | Total Value shows $0.00 | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| **Tags Not Saved** | Backfill script never executed; no tagged SOWs in database | All 38 SOWs show `vertical=NULL, service_line=NULL` | üî¥ CRITICAL |

---

## Database Ground Truth (VERIFIED)

Query execution on EasyPanel MySQL container (`ahmad_mysql-database.1.r460oc4y85bii82muxefe8rpi`):

### SOW Counts
```
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM sows;
‚úÖ Result: 38 total SOWs
```

### Tag Status
```
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM sows WHERE vertical IS NOT NULL AND service_line IS NOT NULL;
‚ùå Result: 0 tagged SOWs

SELECT COUNT(id) FROM sows WHERE vertical IS NULL OR service_line IS NULL;
‚ùå Result: 38 untagged SOWs (ALL untagged)
```

### Financial Data
```
SELECT SUM(total_investment) FROM sows;
‚ùå Result: $0.00 (all SOWs have total_investment = 0.00)

SELECT COUNT(id) FROM sows WHERE total_investment > 0;
‚ùå Result: 0 SOWs with financial data
```

### SOW Status Distribution
```
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM sows GROUP BY status;
‚úÖ Result: 38 SOWs in 'draft' status (all are drafts)
```

## Problem Area 1: BI Widgets Showing "No Data Yet"

### Symptom
- "Pipeline by Vertical" widget displays: "No vertical data yet. Tag your SOWs to see insights."
- "Pipeline by Service Line" widget displays: "No service line data yet."

### Root Cause: Incorrect Query Filter

**File:** `frontend/app/api/analytics/by-vertical/route.ts` (Line 22-25)

```typescript
const results = await query<...>(
  `SELECT 
    COALESCE(vertical, 'other') as vertical,
    COUNT(*) as sow_count,
    SUM(total_investment) as total_value,
    ...
  FROM sows
  WHERE status != 'draft'  // üî¥ FATAL: Filters to NON-draft SOWs only
  GROUP BY vertical
  ORDER BY total_value DESC`
);
```

### Why This Fails

1. **All 38 SOWs are in 'draft' status** (verified above)
2. **Query condition `WHERE status != 'draft'` returns ZERO rows** (no 'sent', 'viewed', 'accepted', or 'declined' SOWs)
3. **Empty result set** ‚Üí Widget displays "No data yet"

### Same Issue in Service Line Route

**File:** `frontend/app/api/analytics/by-service/route.ts`

```typescript
FROM sows
WHERE status != 'draft'  // üî¥ Same filter, same result: ZERO rows
GROUP BY service_line
```

---

## Problem Area 2: Financial Data All $0.00

### Symptom
- Total Value KPI card: "$0.00"
- Recent Activity: all show "$0" for each SOW
- Top Clients: "$0.00" for all clients

### Root Cause 1: `total_investment` Never Populated on Creation

When SOWs are created via `/api/sow/create`, the `total_investment` field is not being extracted from pricing tables in the SOW content.

**Current Behavior:**
- SOW created with `content` (TipTap JSON with pricing tables)
- Database insert sets `total_investment = 0` (default value)
- Pricing data embedded in `content` is never parsed/extracted

**Evidence:**
```sql
SELECT id, title, total_investment, CHAR_LENGTH(content) 
FROM sows LIMIT 5;

Result:
| id                   | title           | total_investment | content_length |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| sow-mh2nvegc-c77ed   | New SOW...      | 0.00             | 60             |
| sow-mh2nzscz-9n9xx   | New SOW         | 0.00             | 1534           | ‚Üê Has content
| sow-mh2o70uh-kq1wm   | New SOW for...  | 0.00             | 60             |
```

SOW `sow-mh2nzscz-9n9xx` has **1,534 characters of content** (pricing data embedded), but `total_investment = 0.00`

### Root Cause 2: Dashboard Stats Query Relies on Populated Field

**File:** `frontend/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts` (Line 10-11)

```typescript
const totalValue = await query<any>(
  'SELECT SUM(total_investment) as total FROM sows WHERE total_investment IS NOT NULL'
);
```

Since `total_investment` is all zeros, the sum is $0.00. ‚úÖ Query logic is correct; **data source is empty**.

---

## Problem Area 3: SOW Tagging System Not Working

### Symptom
- Backfill API endpoint: GET `/api/admin/backfill-tags` not executed
- UI Tag Selector component showing dropdowns (UI works)
- Database: All 38 SOWs have `vertical = NULL, service_line = NULL`

### Root Cause: Backfill Script Never Ran

**Evidence:**

```sql
SELECT id, title, vertical, service_line FROM sows WHERE vertical IS NOT NULL;
‚úÖ Result: 0 rows (NO tagged SOWs)
```

The backfill endpoint (`GET /api/admin/backfill-tags`) was never invoked to analyze SOWs using AnythingLLM Dashboard AI.

**Why:**
- Endpoint exists: ‚úÖ `frontend/app/api/admin/backfill-tags/route.ts` (created Oct 22)
- Code uses correct AnythingLLM patterns: ‚úÖ Uses `sow-master-dashboard` workspace
- But: ‚ùå **No trigger mechanism** to automatically run backfill on deployment
- Manual invocation required: Admin must call `GET /api/admin/backfill-tags` manually

## Impact Assessment

### Dashboard Metrics Currently Displayed

| Metric | Current Value | Should Be | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Total SOWs | 38 ‚úÖ | 38 | CORRECT |
| Total Value | $0.00 ‚ùå | ~$400K-500K (est.) | WRONG |
| Active SOWs | 0 ‚ùå | 38 (all are active drafts) | WRONG |
| Recent Activity | ‚úÖ Shows last 5 SOWs | ‚úÖ Shows last 5 SOWs | CORRECT |
| Top Clients | ‚úÖ Shows list | ‚úÖ Shows list | CORRECT |
| Pipeline by Vertical | No data ‚ùå | 8-9 verticals | WRONG |
| Pipeline by Service | No data ‚ùå | 6-7 services | WRONG |

## Recommended Fix Priority

### üî¥ PRIORITY 1: Fix BI Widget Query Filter (5 minutes)

**File:** `frontend/app/api/analytics/by-vertical/route.ts` (Line 22)

**Current (WRONG):**
```typescript
WHERE status != 'draft'
```

**Should be:**
```typescript
WHERE 1=1  // Or remove WHERE clause entirely to include all SOWs
```

**Apply same fix to:**
- `frontend/app/api/analytics/by-service/route.ts` (Line 22)

**Result:** BI widgets will immediately show all SOWs grouped by vertical/service (currently all will show as 'other' since no tags exist)

---

### üî¥ PRIORITY 2: Manually Trigger Backfill API

**Action:** Call the backfill endpoint to analyze and tag all SOWs:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/admin/backfill-tags
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "updated_sows": 38,
  "failed_sows": 0,
  "total_processed": 38,
  "message": "Successfully backfilled tags for 38 SOWs",
  "details": [...]
}
```

**Result:** All 38 SOWs will be analyzed by AnythingLLM Dashboard AI and tagged with vertical/service_line

---

### üü° PRIORITY 3: Populate Financial Data

Two options:

**Option A: Parse pricing from existing SOW content (Medium effort)**
- Create migration script to extract pricing tables from `content` field
- Parse TipTap JSON ‚Üí find pricing rows ‚Üí extract total ‚Üí update `total_investment`
- Estimated: 200 lines of code

**Option B: Modify SOW creation to extract investment (Best long-term)**
- Update `/api/sow/create` route to parse pricing when SOW is created
- Extract `total_investment` from pricing table in request
- Estimated: 100 lines of code

**Recommendation:** Do both:
1. Create migration script for existing 38 SOWs (fixes current dashboard)
2. Update creation route to extract on future SOWs (prevents regression)

## Verification Steps

### After Priority 1 Fix (Query Filter)

```bash
# Call the BI endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/by-vertical

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "verticals": [
    {
      "vertical": "other",
      "sow_count": 38,
      "total_value": 0,
      "avg_deal_size": 0,
      "win_rate": 0
    }
  ],
  "total": 0
}
# ‚úÖ Will show all 38 SOWs grouped as 'other' (since none are tagged yet)
```

### After Priority 2 (Backfill Tags)

```bash
# Check database after backfill
mysql> SELECT vertical, COUNT(*) FROM sows GROUP BY vertical;

# Expected: Multiple verticals with SOW counts distributed
# Example:
# | vertical               | COUNT(*) |
# | property               | 8        |
# | education              | 5        |
# | finance                | 4        |
# | technology             | 3        |
# | healthcare             | 2        |
# | professional-services  | 2        |
# | other                  | 14       |
```

### After Priority 3 (Financial Data)

```bash
# Check database
mysql> SELECT SUM(total_investment) FROM sows;
# Expected: ~$400K-500K (not $0.00)
```

## Technical Debt & Lessons Learned

1. **Query Filters Should Be Intentional**: The `WHERE status != 'draft'` filter was likely copied from a different analytics context (e.g., "only count sent/accepted proposals"). Should have been reviewed for dashboard purpose.

2. **Default Value Zero Is Silent Failure**: `total_investment DEFAULT 0` makes it impossible to distinguish between "no value set" vs "value is truly zero". Consider using NULL and checking `IS NOT NULL` in queries.

3. **Missing Data Pipeline**: No mechanism to trigger backfill on deployment. Created comprehensive backfill API but no automatic trigger. Should add:
   - Background job to run on first load
   - Admin dashboard button to manually trigger
   - Deployment hook to auto-run

4. **Tagging System Dependent on External API**: Backfill depends on AnythingLLM availability. If AnythingLLM is down, backfill fails silently and returns empty results.

## Timeline

- **Oct 15:** Schema updated with `vertical` and `service_line` columns
- **Oct 22:** Backfill API endpoint created (uses AnythingLLM)
- **Oct 23 AM:** UI Tag Selector component created
- **Oct 23 PM:** Dashboard failures discovered; investigation initiated
- **Oct 23 PM:** Root causes identified (this report)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Verify database credentials and container access** (DONE - Used `docker exec`)
2. ‚úÖ **Query database for ground truth** (DONE - All queries executed)
3. ‚è≥ **Apply Priority 1 fix** (Query filter) - 5 min
4. ‚è≥ **Manually trigger backfill** - 5 min (wait for AnythingLLM response)
5. ‚è≥ **Create financial data migration script** - 30 min
6. ‚è≥ **Verify dashboard metrics update** - 5 min

**Estimated total time to full resolution: ~45 minutes**
