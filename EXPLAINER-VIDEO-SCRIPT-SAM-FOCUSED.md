## üìã VIDEO PRODUCTION NOTES

### Tone & Style
**Narrator Tone:** Professional, factual, evidence-based. Like a technical demonstration, not a sales pitch.

**Pacing:** Deliberate and clear. Let the evidence speak for itself.

**Visual Style:** Clean, minimal, focused on the proof. Show requirements ‚Üí show results ‚Üí verify match.

### Key Differences From Typical Explainer Videos

- ‚úÖ Uses client's exact checklist as structure
- ‚úÖ Positions extras as optional, removable value-adds
- ‚úÖ Focuses on "You asked for this, here's proof we delivered it"

**What This Script DOESN'T Do:**
- ‚ùå Lead with pain points and emotional hooks
- ‚ùå Oversell features not requested
- ‚ùå Hide optional features as "core" platform
- ‚ùå Use generic marketing language
- ‚ùå Assume viewer wants everything
