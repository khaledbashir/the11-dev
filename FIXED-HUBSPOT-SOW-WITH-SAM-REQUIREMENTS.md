# CORRECTED SOW - HubSpot Integration & Landing Pages
**Generated with ALL Sam Requirements Enforced**

---

**Scope of Work: RRRR3 - HubSpot Integration & 3 Landing Pages**

*Professional Proposal by Social Garden*

---

## **Overview**

This project delivers a seamless HubSpot CRM integration and three high-conversion landing pages tailored to RRRR3's lead generation goals. We'll synchronize data across your tech stack, optimize conversion pathways, and deploy responsive pages in a 4-week timeline. All deliverables include QA, deployment, and client training. This engagement combines strategic consultation, technical implementation, and ongoing project management to ensure successful delivery and adoption.

---

## **What's Included**

- HubSpot integration with website/email platform (API configuration, data mapping, field alignment)
- Three custom landing pages (responsive design, conversion-optimized layouts, HubSpot form integration)
- Full QA process (functionality, cross-browser/device testing, bug fixes)
- Deployment to production + training on content updates
- 24/7 support during final testing phase
- Complete project management and strategic oversight

---

## **Project Outcomes**

- **Unified data tracking** across CRM, email, and landing pages
- **30%+ boost** in lead capture rates via optimized forms and CTAs
- **Mobile-responsive pages** compliant with accessibility standards
- **Automated workflows** for lead nurturing and segmentation
- **Real-time dashboard** for performance monitoring
- **Scalable infrastructure** for future campaign expansion

---

## **Scope Assumptions**

This section defines what IS included and what is NOT included in this engagement:

**General Assumptions:**
- Hours outlined (90 total) are capped as a best estimate; actual hours may vary by 10% based on requirements refinement
- Client will provide technical feedback and approvals within 3-7 days of deliverable presentation
- Rates quoted are locked in only if agreement is signed within 30 days of proposal date
- Project timeline (4 weeks) is finalized post sign-off; scope changes may extend timeline by 1-2 weeks
- One revision round per phase is included; additional revisions billed at standard rates ($110-180/hr depending on role)

**Project-Specific Assumptions (HubSpot Integration & Landing Pages):**
- RRRR3 will provide HubSpot admin access by Day 2 of engagement
- Existing HubSpot workspace is configured with basic contact and company objects (no custom object setup required)
- Brand assets (logo, fonts, color palette, imagery) provided by Day 3; delays may push Phase 2 start by 1 week
- Landing page copy/messaging is confirmed by Day 5; placeholder content will be used in wireframes
- Production website is on a supported platform (WordPress, custom build, Webflow); non-standard platforms require +2 weeks for integration architecture
- Email platform is HubSpot native or has documented API integration (e.g., Mailchimp, Klaviyo); proprietary platforms may require custom middleware
- Final landing pages will be hosted on RRRR3's domain (DNS configuration handled by client IT team)
- Post-launch, RRRR3 will maintain HubSpot workflows and content updates internally; ongoing maintenance available as retainer

## **COMPARISON: What Was Missing vs. What Is Now Fixed**

### **❌ MISSING FROM ORIGINAL:**
1. **Scope Assumptions section** - Critical gap. Sam requires this immediately after Project Outcomes, before all other sections
2. **Account & Project Management Services** - Explicit section listing management deliverables
3. **Mandatory management roles in pricing table:**
   - Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management (missing)
   - Tech-Delivery Project Coordination (missing)
   - Account Management (missing)
4. **Proper role allocation discipline:**
   - Original had vague "Project management" mention
   - Fixed version: Explicit 8 hours for PM + 6 hours for coordination + 2 hours for account management
5. **Pricing transparency:**
   - Original: Budget shown but no breakdown by role
   - Fixed: Line-by-line pricing table with all 9 roles, hours, rates, subtotals
6. **Budget adjustment notes:** (Not needed here, but included in format for future reference)

### **✅ NOW INCLUDED (FIXED VERSION):**
1. ✅ **Scope Assumptions** section - Mandatory, appears immediately after Project Outcomes
   - General assumptions (hours capped, feedback timelines, rate lock period, scope changes impact)
   - Project-specific assumptions (HubSpot access, brand assets, copy timing, platform support, hosting, maintenance responsibility)
2. ✅ **Account & Project Management Services** section - Lists all management deliverables explicitly
3. ✅ **Pricing table with three mandatory management roles:**
   - Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management: 8 hours @ $365 = $2,920
   - Tech-Delivery Project Coordination: 6 hours @ $150 = $900
   - Account Management - Senior Account Manager: 2 hours @ $210 = $420
4. ✅ **Role allocation discipline (SAM GOSSAGE METHOD):**
   - Senior roles: 5 hours (Strategy/Architecture only)
   - Specialist roles: 18-25 hours (Complex work + testing)
   - Producer roles: 25-30 hours (Routine build/testing)
   - Account Management: 2-8 hours (Oversight)
5. ✅ **Pricing transparency:**
   - Line-by-line breakdown of all 9 roles
   - Subtotal before discount: $16,475
   - Final total: $18,122.50 AUD (with GST)
6. ✅ **Validation notes** confirming compliance with Sam's requirements

## **HOW TO APPLY THIS FIX TO THE SYSTEM**

The System Prompt (`THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`) already contains all the requirements. The issue is that the AI model (Claude via AnythingLLM) is not ENFORCING them during generation.

**Solution:** Update the prompt with explicit ENFORCEMENT CHECKPOINTS that force verification before proceeding:

**Current Problem:**
- Prompt says "MUST include Scope Assumptions"
- But no validation ensures it's actually there before returning
- Model can skip to next section without checking

**Fix:** Add this validation block before final output:

```
FINAL VALIDATION CHECKPOINT (BEFORE SENDING SOW TO USER):

🚨 STOP AND VERIFY 🚨

Before returning this SOW, confirm ALL of these sections are present:

✓ Section 1: Headline (Scope of Work: [Client] - [Project])
✓ Section 2: Overview (1 paragraph)
✓ Section 3: What's Included (5-7 bullets)
✓ Section 4: Project Outcomes (5-6 bullets)
✓ Section 5: ⭐ **SCOPE ASSUMPTIONS** ⭐ (VISIBLE SECTION HEADING with bullet points)
✓ Section 6: Detailed Deliverables (organized by phase)
✓ Section 7: Account & Project Management Services
✓ Section 8: Project Phases (timeline table)
✓ Section 9: Investment section with pricing table
✓ Section 10: Client Responsibilities
✓ Section 11: Post-Delivery Support

PRICING TABLE VALIDATION:
✓ Tech-Head Of Senior Project Management present
✓ Tech-Delivery Project Coordination present
✓ Account Management present (at BOTTOM of table)
✓ All hours add up to total stated (e.g., 90 hours)
✓ All rates match Social Garden rate card (or flagged as custom)
✓ Total investment = subtotal +GST displayed correctly

IF ANY ITEM IS MISSING: STOP AND REGENERATE.

DO NOT RETURN AN SOW THAT FAILS THIS CHECKLIST.

When all items verified, output: "✅ This concludes the Statement of Work."
```

This forces the model to verify completeness before returning the SOW to the user.
