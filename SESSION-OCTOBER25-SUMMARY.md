**Result:** Management services now VISIBLE to clients, not hidden in pricing table

## üìù For Future Developers

### Important Notes (Read This!)

1. **Auto-Deployment Works**
   - Every `git push` ‚Üí Auto-deploy on EasyPanel
   - No manual steps needed
   - Wait ~5 min for build & deploy

2. **Known Issues Exist**
   - See SOW-REQUIREMENTS-CHECKLIST.md for list
   - Prioritized by impact (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Each has actionable fix steps

3. **SOW Prompt is Critical**
   - Changes to THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT affect all generated SOWs
   - Use ‚≠ê markers to emphasize CRITICAL sections
   - Add ENFORCEMENT statements where needed

4. **Testing Workflow**
   - Test locally: `npm run dev`
   - Verify build: `npm run build`
   - Commit with clear message
   - Push to GitHub (auto-deploys)
   - Verify in production

5. **Portal Page Logic**
   - `/portal/sow/[id]/page.tsx` is complex
   - Contains pricing calculator, AI chat, PDF/Excel export
   - Multiple tabs (Overview, Content, Pricing, Timeline)
   - Be careful with state management
