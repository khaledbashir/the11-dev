# üß™ TESTING GUIDE - Final Two Bugs Fix

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Testing  
**Tester:** Sam / QA Team

---

## üéØ WHAT WAS FIXED

Two critical bugs preventing client-ready output:

1. **Financial Inconsistency in PDF** - Dual conflicting prices showing in exported PDFs
2. **AI Preamble Leaking into SOW** - Conversational text appearing in client documents

---

## üìã TEST PLAN

### TEST 1: Financial Consistency in PDF Export

**Objective:** Verify that PDFs show ONLY the AI-specified final investment target, with NO computed summary duplication.

#### Steps:

1. **Generate a New SOW with Final Price Override**
   - Open the SOW application
   - Start a new document
   - In the chat, ask the AI: *"Create a Standard Project SOW for a website redesign with a final investment target of $10,000"*
   - Wait for AI to generate the SOW
   - The AI response should include a narrative mentioning "$10,000" as the target

2. **Insert to Editor**
   - Click "Insert to Editor" button
   - Verify content is inserted into the editor

3. **Export to PDF**
   - Click the "Export PDF" button
   - Wait for PDF to download

4. **Verify PDF Content**
   - Open the downloaded PDF
   - Scroll to the bottom of the document
   - **EXPECTED:** You should see:
     - ‚úÖ A "Summary" section with a single row table
     - ‚úÖ "Final Project Value: $10,000" (or whatever price AI specified)
     - ‚úÖ Disclaimer: "This final project value is authoritative and supersedes any computed totals."
     - ‚ùå **NO** detailed computed summary table showing subtotals, GST, discounts, etc.
   - **FAILED IF:** You see both the authoritative price AND a computed summary table

#### Expected Results:
- [ ] PDF contains ONLY the AI-specified final investment target
- [ ] NO duplicate summary sections
- [ ] Financial information is coherent and professional

### TEST 2: AI Preamble Stripping

**Objective:** Verify that conversational AI text is removed before insertion into the editor.

#### Steps:

1. **Generate a New SOW**
   - Open the SOW application
   - Start a new document
   - In the chat, ask the AI: *"Generate a comprehensive SOW for mobile app development"*
   - **Watch the AI response carefully**

2. **Check AI Response in Chat**
   - Look for conversational preambles like:
     - "I'll create a comprehensive SOW..."
     - "Here's the Statement of Work..."
     - "Below is the detailed scope..."
   - **Note:** The AI MIGHT generate this text (it's normal in the chat)

3. **Insert to Editor**
   - Click "Insert to Editor" button

4. **Verify Editor Content**
   - Look at the FIRST line of content in the editor
   - **EXPECTED:** The document should start with:
     - ‚úÖ A formal heading like "Executive Summary" or "Scope of Work"
     - ‚ùå **NO** conversational text like "I'll create..." or "Here's..."

5. **Export to PDF and Double-Check**
   - Click "Export PDF"
   - Open the PDF
   - Check the first line after the logo
   - **EXPECTED:** PDF starts with formal heading, NO preamble

#### Expected Results:
- [ ] Editor content starts with formal document heading
- [ ] NO conversational AI preamble in editor
- [ ] PDF output is professional and client-ready from the first line
- [ ] Console shows: `üßπ Stripped AI preamble: ...` (if preamble was detected)

---

### TEST 3: Combined Test (Real-World Scenario)

**Objective:** Test both fixes together in a realistic workflow.

#### Steps:

1. **Create Complex SOW**
   - Ask AI: *"Create a detailed SOW for an enterprise CRM implementation with multiple phases. The client has agreed to a final investment of $50,000."*

2. **Verify Chat Output**
   - Check if AI response has preamble text
   - Check if AI narrative mentions "$50,000"

3. **Insert and Review**
   - Insert to editor
   - Verify:
     - [ ] No preamble at start of document
     - [ ] Content begins with formal heading
     - [ ] Document structure is intact

4. **Export PDF**
   - Export to PDF
   - Verify:
     - [ ] No preamble in PDF
     - [ ] Only shows "$50,000" final investment target
     - [ ] No computed summary duplication
     - [ ] Professional appearance throughout

#### Expected Results:
- [ ] Clean professional document from start to finish
- [ ] Single authoritative price in PDF
- [ ] No AI conversational text
- [ ] Ready for client delivery

## üîç DEBUGGING TIPS

### If Test 1 Fails (Dual Summaries Still Showing):

1. **Check Backend Logs:**
   ```bash
   docker logs ahmad_socialgarden-backend.1.v40j8p4qzj4d4czrc1btylwex | tail -50
   ```
   - Look for: `‚úÖ Stripped computed summary section from HTML`
   - Look for: `üí∞ Final Investment Target: ...`

2. **Check Request Payload:**
   - Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Find the `/api/generate-pdf` request
   - Check the JSON payload
   - Verify `final_investment_target_text` field is present

3. **Verify Backend Restart:**
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep backend
   ```
   - Check "Up X minutes" - should be recent (< 10 minutes)

### If Test 2 Fails (Preamble Still Showing):

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
   - Look for: `üßπ Stripped AI preamble: ...`
   - If this message appears, the detection worked

2. **Verify Content Before/After:**
   - In browser console, before clicking "Insert"
   - Run: `localStorage.getItem('debugLastAIResponse')`
   - Check if preamble detection keywords are present

3. **Check Export Utils:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "Strip AI conversational preamble" /root/the11-dev/frontend/lib/export-utils.ts
   ```
   - Should show the fix at the correct line

## üêõ KNOWN EDGE CASES

### Edge Case 1: Very Short Preambles
If the AI generates a very short preamble (< 10 characters), it might not be detected. This is acceptable as short text is less disruptive.

### Edge Case 2: No Formal Heading
If the AI generates content with NO H1/H2 headings (rare), the preamble stripper won't activate. This is acceptable as well-formed SOWs always have headings.

### Edge Case 3: No Final Price Override
If the user doesn't specify a final investment target, the old behavior (computed summary) should still work. Test this by:
- Generate SOW without mentioning "final investment" or "final price"
- Verify computed summary table appears in PDF
- This is EXPECTED behavior (not a bug)

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

All tests pass if:

1. **Financial Consistency:**
   - When AI specifies a final price, PDF shows ONLY that price
   - NO duplicate summary sections
   - Disclaimer text is present

2. **Content Sanitization:**
   - Editor never shows conversational AI preambles
   - Documents always start with formal headings
   - PDFs are client-ready from line 1

3. **No Regressions:**
   - Normal computed summaries still work (when no final price override)
   - All other PDF formatting is intact
   - Editor insertion still works correctly
