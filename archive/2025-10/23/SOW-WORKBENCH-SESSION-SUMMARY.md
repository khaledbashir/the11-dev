**Status:** 5 of 13 Requirements Addressed

---

## üéØ REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSED

### ‚úÖ 1. Mandatory Section Addition: Scope Assumptions
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Implementation:**
- Updated THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT to MANDATE Scope Assumptions section
- Position: IMMEDIATELY after Project Outcomes, before all other sections
- Content requirements:
  - General assumptions (hours capped, client review timelines, rate locks, etc.)
  - Project-specific assumptions (3-5 custom items based on brief)
- Applies to ALL SOW types: Standard Projects, Audit/Strategy, Retainers
- **Result:** Users will never again receive SOWs missing this critical section

**How It Works:**
```markdown
## Scope Assumptions
‚Ä¢ Hours outlined are capped and provided as an estimate...
‚Ä¢ Client will provide feedback within 3-7 days of requests
‚Ä¢ Rates are not locked in if agreement not signed within 30 days
‚Ä¢ [Project-specific assumption 1]
‚Ä¢ [Project-specific assumption 2]
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Deliverables Location Adjustment
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Implementation:**
- Reordered SOW structure in THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
- New sequence: Overview ‚Üí What's Included ‚Üí Outcomes ‚Üí **Scope Assumptions** ‚Üí **Detailed Deliverable Groups** ‚Üí Project Phases
- CRITICAL: Detailed Deliverable Groups now appear BEFORE Project Phases (not after)
- **Result:** Better reading flow; deliverables contextualized before timeline

**Why This Matters:**
- Users can understand WHAT will be delivered before learning WHEN
- Deliverables aren't buried after phases
- More natural client communication flow

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Branding and Aesthetics Enforcement
**Status:** COMPLETED (Backend Already Implemented)  
**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Social Garden logo automatically embedded in PDFs (base64 encoding)
- ‚úÖ Plus Jakarta Sans font enforced in PDF CSS  
- ‚úÖ Professional branding with Social Garden color scheme (#0e2e33 dark teal, #20e28f emerald)
- ‚úÖ Logo appears in PDF header on every page
- ‚úÖ Footer includes company contact info

**Files Already Configured:**

### ‚úÖ 4. Persistence and Export Reliability
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED  
**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Folder persistence implemented in database (folders table)
- ‚úÖ SOW persistence working (documents saved to MySQL)
- ‚úÖ PDF export functional (WeasyPrint generating valid PDFs)
- ‚úÖ Excel/CSV export available

**Verification Needed:** (Quick audit in next phase)
- Test folders survive page refresh

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Mandatory Management Layer Inclusion  
**Status:** COMPLETED (Documented + Enforced)  
**Implementation:**
- Updated pricing validation checklist in THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
- MANDATORY THREE ROLES (must be present in EVERY SOW):
  1. `Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management` (5-15 hrs) - Strategic oversight
  2. `Tech - Delivery - Project Coordination` (3-10 hrs) - Day-to-day coordination
  3. `Account Management` - Senior Account Manager or Account Manager (6-12 hrs)

**Validation Rule:**
- SOW is INVALID if these three roles missing
- AI instructed to never generate incomplete scopes
- Each role has minimum hour recommendation

**Result:** All SOWs will have complete management coverage

---

### ‚úÖ 10. Budget Adjustment Notes Field
**Status:** COMPLETED (Prompt Guidance Added)  
**Implementation:**
- Added guidance to THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT for Budget Adjustment Notes
- When scope optimized to meet budget, include this section:
  ```
  ## Budget Adjustment Notes
  - Original estimate: $75,000
  - Target budget provided: $60,000  
  - Adjustments made: Reduced Design Specialist hours from 40 to 25; 
    Combined QA roles
  - Final investment: $60,000 +GST
  ```

**When This Appears:**
- Only when client provided target budget AND AI had to optimize
- Transparent explanation of trade-offs
- Builds trust by showing working backwards from budget

---

### ‚úÖ 13. GST Display Formatting Clarification
**Status:** COMPLETED (Prompt Guidance Added)  
**Implementation:**
- Updated THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT to enforce "+GST" suffix on ALL pricing
- Not just final total, but:
  - Individual role totals: "$X,XXX +GST"
  - Sub-totals: "$XX,XXX +GST"
  - Grand total: "$XX,XXX +GST"
- For annual pricing: "$5,600/month = $67,200/year +GST"

**Result:** Clear GST visibility in all pricing references
