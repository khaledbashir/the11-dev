# üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - ONE SIMPLE FIX

Based on your screenshots, the issue is crystal clear and **can be fixed in 30 seconds**.

---

## The Problem

You have a reverse proxy domain `ahmad-socialgarden-backend.840tjq.easypanel.host` that points to:
- **Internal Host**: `ahmad_socialgarden-backend`
- **Port**: `80` ‚Üê **THIS IS WRONG**

FastAPI backend needs to run on port 8000, not 80.

---

## The Fix (30 seconds)

1. Open EasyPanel
2. Go to **ahmad-socialgarden-backend service**
3. Click the **Domains/Middlewares tab**
4. Click **Update Domain** on the reverse proxy configuration
5. Change:
   - **Port**: from `80` to `8000`
   - **Protocol**: `HTTP` (keep as is)
6. Click **Save**

**That's it.**

---

## Why This Works

- FastAPI backend listens on port 8000
- Currently the domain was pointing to port 80 (default HTTP)
- Frontend tries to call `/generate-pdf` on this domain
- Port 80 has nothing (or wrong service), so you get 404
- Port 8000 has the actual PDF service you need

---

## After You Make This Change

1. Save the domain configuration
2. Wait 30 seconds for EasyPanel to apply changes
3. Hard refresh your browser: **Ctrl+Shift+R**
4. Try exporting a PDF
5. It should work ‚úÖ

---

## Proof This Is the Issue

- ‚úÖ Frontend code is correct (we tested it locally)
- ‚úÖ Route handler works (tested with curl)
- ‚ùå Port 80 is configured (shown in your screenshot)
- ‚úÖ Port 8000 is where backend runs (FastAPI default)

The only thing between "404 error" and "working PDF export" is changing one number in EasyPanel from 80 to 8000.

---

## If This Doesn't Work

After changing the port:
1. Test: `curl https://ahmad-socialgarden-backend.840tjq.easypanel.host/docs`
   - Should see FastAPI Swagger docs (not 404 page)
2. If still 404, check:
   - Is there an actual backend service running?
   - Is it deployed and healthy?
   - Are the service logs showing errors?

But 99% sure the port change will fix it.
