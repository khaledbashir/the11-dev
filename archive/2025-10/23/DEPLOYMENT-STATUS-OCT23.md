# Deployment Status - October 23, 2025

## Current Issue: PDF Export Returns 404

**Symptom**: POST to `/api/generate-pdf` returns Next.js 404 page HTML (not a real 404 error)

**Root Cause**: The EasyPanel frontend deployment is running an **old build** that was created before the `/api/generate-pdf` route was added to the codebase.

**Solution**: Force a complete rebuild on EasyPanel

---

## What I Just Did

1. ‚úÖ Added a code comment with timestamp to `/api/generate-pdf/route.ts`
2. ‚úÖ Pushed commit: `fix: Cache invalidation - force EasyPanel rebuild of PDF endpoint`
3. ‚è≥ **WAITING FOR EASYPANEL CI/CD TO PICK UP THE NEW COMMIT**

## Timeline

| Time | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Earlier | Pushed empty commit | ‚ùå Didn't trigger rebuild |
| Just now | Pushed real code change | ‚è≥ Waiting for pickup |
| +1-3 min | EasyPanel detects new commit | ‚è≥ TBD |
| +3-5 min | Docker build starts | ‚è≥ TBD |
| +7-10 min | Build completes, new container starts | ‚è≥ TBD |
| +10-15 min | Route should work | ‚è≥ TBD |

## What to Do Now

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Rebuild (Recommended)
- Wait 10-15 minutes for EasyPanel to rebuild
- Then hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Try PDF export again

### Option 2: Manual Rebuild in EasyPanel (Faster)
If you have EasyPanel access:
1. Go to **sow-frontend** service
2. Click **"Build and Deploy"** button
3. Wait for completion (3-5 minutes)
4. Hard refresh and try PDF export

### Option 3: Check Deployment Status
```bash
# In EasyPanel, go to sow-frontend ‚Üí Activity/Logs
# Look for lines like:
# - "Building Docker image..."
# - "Pushing to registry..."
# - "Container started"
```

## Verification After Rebuild

Once rebuild is complete:

1. **Hard refresh** the page (don't just F5 - use Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open developer console (F12)
3. Try to export SOW to PDF
4. Check console logs for:
   - ‚úÖ `üîç [POST /api/generate-pdf] Request received` = Route found
   - ‚úÖ `üîó [PDF Service] Using URL: https://ahmad-socialgarden-backend.840tjq.easypanel.host` = Backend URL correct
   - ‚úÖ `‚úÖ [PDF Service] PDF generated successfully` = SUCCESS

---

## Key Files Updated

- `frontend/app/api/generate-pdf/route.ts` - Added cache-bust comment
- **GitHub commit**: `1665125`

## Backend Configuration (Already Done)

‚úÖ Port changed from 80 to 8000 in EasyPanel backend configuration  
‚úÖ Environment variable set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PDF_SERVICE_URL=https://ahmad-socialgarden-backend.840tjq.easypanel.host`

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

After waiting 15+ minutes and doing a hard refresh, if PDF still returns 404:

1. Check EasyPanel build logs - did it actually build?
2. Verify `/images/logo-light.png` is also loading (this should work to test static files)
3. Check browser cache - try incognito mode
4. If still 404: May need manual intervention in EasyPanel UI

**Contact**: Check EasyPanel support if automatic rebuild fails
