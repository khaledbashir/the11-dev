## Architecture Overview

### 3 AI Systems (Confirmed)

| System | Purpose | Backend | Prompt | Access |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Dashboard AI** | Query all SOWs (analytics) | AnythingLLM master | Analytics-focused | `/api/anythingllm/stream-chat` |
| **Gen AI (Architect)** | Create SOWs for clients | AnythingLLM per-client | **THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT** | `/api/anythingllm/stream-chat` |
| **Inline Editor** | Text editing/expansion | OpenRouter direct | User selects model | `/api/generate` |

### Unified Deployment
- **Frontend:** Next.js on EasyPanel (sow-qandu-me)
- **Backend:** FastAPI on EasyPanel (socialgarden-backend)
- **Database:** MySQL on EasyPanel (ahmad-mysql-database - unified, all production data)
- **AI:** AnythingLLM on EasyPanel (ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host)

---

## 5 Requirements Summary

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Mandatory 3-Role Team Composition
**Requirement:** Every SOW must include:
- Account Manager (6-12 hrs)
- Project Coordination (3-10 hrs)
- Head Of / Senior Management (5-15 hrs)

**Validation:** If any missing ‚Üí SOW INVALID

**Code:** Section 9, MANDATORY TEAM COMPOSITION

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Account Manager at BOTTOM
**Requirement:** Account Manager hours always at bottom of pricing table (just before TOTAL)

**Standard Order:**
1. Strategic/Tech roles
2. Delivery/Implementation roles
3. Project Coordination
4. Account Management (LAST)

**Code:** Section 8, CRITICAL ROLE ORDERING

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Split Roles Strategy
**Requirement:** Production work split across Specialist/Producer roles, NOT just Senior

**Example for HubSpot:**
- Architects: 5-10 hrs (strategy/design)
- Specialists: 15-20 hrs (complex implementation)
- Producers: 30-40 hrs (routine tasks)

**Result:** 30% senior, 70% specialist/producer

**Code:** Section 2 + Section 9, ROLE ALLOCATION STRATEGY

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Price Rounding
**Requirement:** Round final totals to nearest $5,000

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ $45,000 (good)
- ‚úÖ $50,000 (good)
- ‚úÖ $55,000 (good)
- ‚ùå $47,310 (bad)
- ‚ùå $52,847 (bad)

**Code:** Section 4, PRICING ROUNDING

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Discount Mechanism
**Requirement:** Include optional discount field for negotiation

**Example:**
```
Subtotal: $50,000
GST (10%): $5,000
TOTAL: $55,000

Optional: 15% commitment discount = $46,750/year
```

**Code:** Section 4 + Section 9, VALIDATION CHECKLIST

---

## Next Steps (User Action Required)

### Step 1: Redeploy Frontend ‚è≥
**What to do:**
1. Go to EasyPanel dashboard
2. Navigate to **sow-qandu-me** service
3. Click **"Redeploy"** button
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete

**Why:** Updates THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT to frontend code

---

### Step 2: Test SOW Generation üß™
**What to do:**
1. Refresh https://sow.qandu.me in browser
2. Create NEW workspace: **"HubSpot Integration - Real Estate"** (type = SOW)
3. Send message:
   ```
   Create a Scope of Work for HubSpot CRM integration and 3 landing pages 
   for a real estate company with a $35,000 budget. Include all necessary 
   phases, deliverables, and team requirements.
   ```

**Expected Output:**
- Proper SOW format with phases, deliverables
- Rate card pricing table with all roles

---

### Step 3: Verify All 5 Requirements ‚úÖ

Check that generated SOW includes:

#### ‚úÖ Requirement 1: Mandatory 3 Roles
- [ ] Account Manager line in pricing table (6-12 hrs range)
- [ ] Project Coordination line in pricing table (3-10 hrs range)
- [ ] Head Of / Senior Management line in pricing table (5-15 hrs range)

#### ‚úÖ Requirement 2: Account Manager at BOTTOM
- [ ] Account Manager is the LAST role (just before TOTAL line)
- [ ] Not scattered in middle of list

#### ‚úÖ Requirement 3: Role Split
- [ ] Mix of Specialist + Producer roles visible
- [ ] Not 100% senior roles
- [ ] Example: "Specialist Developer" + "Producer Development" roles present

#### ‚úÖ Requirement 4: Rounded Pricing
- [ ] Investment total is rounded (e.g., $35,000, $40,000, $45,000)
- [ ] Not odd number like $33,847 or $37,310

#### ‚úÖ Requirement 5: Discount Mechanism
- [ ] Discount line present (e.g., "Available discount for commitment")
- [ ] Shows optional negotiation point

---

## If Any Requirement Fails

### Issue: Account Manager Missing
**Fix:** 
1. The prompt explicitly mandates it now
2. If still missing, check anythingllm.ts applies prompt correctly
3. Verify workspace created with type="sow"

### Issue: Account Manager Not at BOTTOM
**Fix:**
1. The prompt now has explicit ordering instruction
2. May need to regenerate SOW (AI might not reorder existing)

### Issue: Only Senior Roles (No Specialist Split)
**Fix:**
1. The prompt now has detailed role allocation strategy
2. Check that Specialist and Producer roles are in rate card
3. May need to regenerate SOW

### Issue: Pricing Not Rounded
**Fix:**
1. The prompt now includes rounding method
2. AI should round automatically
3. Check for rounding line in SOW (e.g., "rounded to nearest $5k")

### Issue: No Discount Mechanism
**Fix:**
1. The prompt mentions optional discount field
2. May appear in a "Special Terms" section
3. Look for "Available discount" language
