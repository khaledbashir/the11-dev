```

✅ **Code is in place** - Accordion component is integrated

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Refresh & Send Message

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Send a message** to the AI in the sidebar chat
3. **Open console** (F12)

### Step 2: Look for These Logs

You should see ONE of these:

**Option A: Thinking Found** ✅
```javascript
✅ HAS THINKING TAGS! {
  messageId: "msg...",
  thinkingPreview: "Let me analyze this request: 1. Work Type...",
  isStreaming: true
}

🎯 [Accordion] THINKING EXTRACTED: {
  thinkingLength: 245,
  thinkingPreview: "Let me analyze this request...",
  hasThinkingContent: true
}
```

**Option B: No Thinking** ❌
```javascript
❌ NO THINKING TAGS {
  messageId: "msg...",
  contentStart: "Here's a comprehensive SOW...",
  isStreaming: true
}
```

## What Each Means

### If You See "✅ HAS THINKING TAGS!"

**The thinking IS there!** Look in the chat message for:

```
🧠 AI Thinking... 
↓ Click this to expand
```

OR

```
🧠 AI Reasoning
↓ Already expanded
```

**It looks like this:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧠 AI Thinking... 🟡🟡🟡  ▼             │ ← Click to expand
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ (Thinking content hidden)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Here's a comprehensive SOW for your project...
(Rest of the response)
```

**Or when expanded:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧠 AI Reasoning  ▲                      │ ← Click to collapse
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Let me analyze this request:            │
│                                         │
│ 1. Work Type: This is a Standard       │
│    Project - it's a defined build...   │
│                                         │
│ 2. Client: ATY Real Estate Agency      │
│    Budget: $5,000 AUD                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Here's a comprehensive SOW for your project...
(Rest of the response)
```

2. Settings → Chat Model
3. Change to: **DeepSeek V3** or **DeepSeek R1**

## Still Can't Find It?

### Check Visual Location

The thinking accordion appears:
- **Above** the final answer
- **Inside** the AI message bubble
- **Between** the message header and the actual response

**Look for:**
- 🧠 Brain emoji
- Yellow dots (during streaming)
- "AI Thinking..." or "AI Reasoning" text
- Clickable header bar

### Take a Screenshot

If you still can't find it:
1. Send a message to AI
2. Take a screenshot of the entire chat panel
3. Show me the screenshot

I'll tell you exactly where to look!

## Expected Behavior

**During Streaming:**
```
🧠 AI Thinking... 🟡🟡🟡
↓
Accordion auto-expands
↓
Thinking text appears character-by-character
↓
Final answer streams below
```

**After Complete:**
```
🧠 AI Reasoning
↓
Click to expand/collapse
↓
Review thinking anytime
```

## Quick Test

Send this exact message to the AI:

```
Analyze the tradeoffs between using a monolithic architecture 
versus microservices for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. 
Consider scalability, cost, complexity, and vendor lock-in.
```

This complex question will **force the AI to show its reasoning**.
