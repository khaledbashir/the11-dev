## üìù Documentation Philosophy

**One source of truth:** [README.md](../README.md) has everything to get started.

**Specialized docs:** Technical planning docs live in `/docs/`.

**Archive:** Old session notes in `/docs/archive/` for historical reference.

**No duplication:** Each piece of info exists in ONE place only.
