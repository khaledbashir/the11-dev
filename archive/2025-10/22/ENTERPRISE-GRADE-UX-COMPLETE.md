## ✨ Feature 1: Auto-Agent Selection

### What It Does
- **Dashboard mode** → Automatically selects "Business Analyst"
- **Editor mode** → Automatically selects "The Architect"
- No more manual dropdown selection needed
- Context hint shows why each agent was selected

### Files Modified
- `frontend/components/tailwind/agent-sidebar-clean.tsx`
  - Added `useEffect` to watch `viewMode` and `agents`
  - Auto-detects and selects appropriate agent
  - Added visual hint below dropdown

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Auto-select agent based on view mode
useEffect(() => {
  if (viewMode === 'dashboard') {
    const businessAnalyst = agents.find(a => 
      a.name.toLowerCase().includes('business') || 
      a.name.toLowerCase().includes('analyst')
    );
    if (businessAnalyst?.id && businessAnalyst.id !== currentAgentId) {
      onSelectAgent(businessAnalyst.id);
    }
  } else if (viewMode === 'editor') {
    const architect = agents.find(a => 
      a.name.toLowerCase().includes('architect') || 
      a.id.includes('architect')
    );
    if (architect?.id && architect.id !== currentAgentId) {
      onSelectAgent(architect.id);
    }
  }
}, [viewMode, agents, currentAgentId, onSelectAgent]);
```

  workspaceName,
  currentStep: 0,
  completedSteps: [],
});

setWorkspaceCreationProgress(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  completedSteps: [0],
