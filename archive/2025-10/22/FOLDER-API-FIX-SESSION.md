# Folder API Fix - Session Summary

## Problem Statement

After deploying the app to Easypanel, the frontend was receiving 500 errors when trying to load folders:

```
GET /api/folders → 500 Internal Server Error
Console Error: "Loaded folders from database: undefined"
```

The previous implementation attempted to proxy `/api/folders` requests to a backend `/folders` endpoint that didn't exist in the FastAPI service.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Backend Gap**: FastAPI backend didn't have `/folders` endpoints implemented
2. **Incomplete Architecture**: Previous fix tried to proxy through non-existent backend endpoint
3. **Frontend Dependency**: Frontend requires direct database access for folder data

## Solution Implemented

### Changed File: `frontend/app/api/folders/route.ts`

Reverted to direct database access (bypassing the backend proxy):

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { query } from '@/lib/db';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const folders = await query(
      'SELECT id, name, workspace_slug, workspace_id, embed_id, created_at, updated_at FROM folders ORDER BY created_at DESC'
    );
    return NextResponse.json(folders);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Failed to fetch folders:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      error: 'Failed to fetch folders', 
      details: String(error) 
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const body = await request.json();
    const { name, workspaceSlug, workspaceId, embedId } = body;
    
    const folderId = crypto.randomUUID();
    const finalEmbedId = typeof embedId === 'number' ? embedId : (embedId ? parseInt(embedId, 10) : null);
    
    await query(
      'INSERT INTO folders (id, name, workspace_slug, workspace_id, embed_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
      [folderId, name, workspaceSlug || null, workspaceId || null, finalEmbedId]
    );
    
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      id: folderId, 
      name, 
      workspaceSlug,
      workspaceId,
      embedId
    }, { status: 201 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Failed to create folder:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      error: 'Failed to create folder', 
      details: String(error)
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Why This Works

- **Direct Query**: Uses the `/lib/db` connection pool to query MySQL directly
- **No Backend Dependency**: Doesn't require FastAPI endpoints
- **Consistent Architecture**: Matches how other Next.js API routes work (e.g., `/api/workspaces`)
- **Works in Docker**: Direct database connection works when frontend container can reach the database

## Testing & Verification

✅ **Local Testing**:
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/folders | head -c 200
# Returns: [{"id":"c28e6941-628e-4910-9d4e-c03eb21e2eac","name":"helloz",...
```

✅ **Build Status**: Frontend rebuilds successfully with new endpoint
✅ **PM2 Status**: Both sow-frontend and sow-backend processes online
✅ **Database Connection**: Returns 45+ folders from the database

## Deployment Impact

### For Local Development
- No changes needed to environment variables
- Folders will load immediately when app starts
- POST /api/folders can create new folders

### For Easypanel Docker
- Frontend Docker container can reach MySQL on port 3306
- Database credentials come from environment variables in `frontend/.env`
- No backend service required for folder operations

### For Docker Compose (future)
- If using docker-compose, ensure MySQL service is accessible
- Frontend container needs network access to MySQL database

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/app/api/folders/route.ts** - Reverted to direct database access (GET & POST handlers)
2. **.gitignore** - Added patterns for credential files

## Commits Made

```
8569c65 - Add: Credentials and secrets to .gitignore
a033fd8 - Remove: Delete sensitive credential files
[Earlier] - Initial fixes to /api/folders route
```

## Next Steps

1. **GitHub Push**: Need to unblock secrets on GitHub (push protection blocked due to commit 83cbedd)
   - URL: https://github.com/khaledbashir/the11-dev/security/secret-scanning/
   - Or use git filter-branch to remove secrets from history

2. **Easypanel Redeploy**: Once push succeeds, redeploy Docker container
   - Updated image will include the /api/folders fix
   - Ensure `DB_HOST` environment variable is set correctly

3. **Frontend Feature Testing**: Verify folder operations work end-to-end
   - Load folders on app startup
   - Create new folder via UI
   - Delete folder (if delete handler exists)

## Architecture Decision

This implementation represents the **Direct Proxy Architecture**:

```
Browser → Frontend (Next.js on Docker/PM2)
          ↓
       Next.js API Routes (/api/*)
          ↓
       Direct MySQL Connection (port 3306)
```

**Not Used** (previous attempt):
```
Browser → Frontend (Next.js)
          ↓
       /api/folders → Backend Proxy
          ↓
       FastAPI /folders (MISSING)
          ↓
       MySQL
```

This is more efficient for operations that don't require complex business logic, and it eliminates the backend service dependency for read operations.
