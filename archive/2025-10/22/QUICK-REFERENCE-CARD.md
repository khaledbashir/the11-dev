## 2Ô∏è‚É£ GEN ARCH PROMPT UPDATE

### What's New (If Adopted)

| Feature | Benefit | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Multiple Options** | Handle "Basic, Standard, Premium" separately | Generates 3 SOWs, each with own pricing |
| **Budget Notes** | Explain rounding adjustments | "Adjusted $47k‚Üí$50k by reducing hours" |
| **Google Sheets** | Auto-archive SOWs | User types `/pushtosheet` to export |

### Decision: Keep or Update?

**Keep Current:** ‚úÖ Works fine, no new features  
**Update (Hybrid):** ‚úÖ Better + new features + all details saved

**My Recommendation:** Update (Hybrid) - Takes 15 minutes
