# üö® EasyPanel Build Timeout - Status Update

**Date**: October 22, 2025, 22:30 UTC  
**Status**: Build Canceled (but site may already be working)

---

## Current Situation

EasyPanel is **timing out** during `pnpm build` phase. But here's the thing:

**The site might ALREADY BE WORKING** even though the build says it failed.

---

## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Test If Site Already Works (DO THIS FIRST)

```
1. Go to https://sow.qandu.me
2. Open DevTools (Press F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Try: Create new workspace
5. Look for request to /api/v1/workspace/333/update
   - If 200/201: ‚úÖ Code is deployed, build worked
   - If 404: ‚ùå Build failed, need to retry
```

### If Site Works (LIKELY SCENARIO):
```
‚úÖ Build succeeded (just bad logging)
‚úÖ Go straight to Step 2: Update environment variables
‚úÖ Skip the rebuild
```

### If Site Doesn't Work:
```
‚ùå Build actually failed
‚è≥ Set env vars first (below)
‚è≥ Then manually trigger redeploy
```

---

## Step 2: Update Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

This is the **KEY FIX** that will solve the 404 errors.

**Do this now** (whether build works or not):

1. Go to EasyPanel ‚Üí **sow-frontend** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. **Add/Update** these variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ANYTHINGLLM_URL=https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host
   ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY=0G0WTZ3-6ZX4D20-H35VBRG-9059WPA
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://sow.qandu.me
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://168.231.115.219:8000
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PDF_SERVICE_URL=http://168.231.115.219:8000
   DB_HOST=168.231.115.219
   DB_USER=sg_sow_user
   DB_PASSWORD=SG_sow_2025_SecurePass!
   DB_NAME=socialgarden_sow
   ```
3. Click **Save/Deploy**
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for rebuild

---

## Step 3: If Build Fails Again

If env vars are set and build still times out:

See: `EASYPANEL-BUILD-TIMEOUT-FIX.md` for workarounds

---

## Step 4: Reset Master Dashboard

After env vars are deployed:

1. Go to AnythingLLM: https://ahmad-anything-llm.840tjq.easypanel.host
2. Workspaces ‚Üí Find **sow-master-dashboard** ‚Üí Delete
3. Refresh https://sow.qandu.me
4. Dashboard will auto-recreate

---

## Quick Fact Check

**Most likely**: Build succeeded, site is already working  
**Reason**: Next.js can finish building before Docker timeout  
**Evidence needed**: Test https://sow.qandu.me

**TL;DR**: Test site first. If works, just add env vars. If not, add env vars and retry deploy.
