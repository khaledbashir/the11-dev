# üèõÔ∏è THE ARCHITECT Prompt Update - OFFICIAL RECOMMENDATION

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Analysis:** Complete comparison of current vs. new system prompt  
**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **YES - ADOPT (with adaptations)**

---

## EXECUTIVE DECISION

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive but verbose (~2,000 words)
- ‚úÖ Strong on operational details (roles, formats, examples)
- ‚ùå Missing: Multiple options handling
- ‚ùå Missing: Google Sheets integration
- ‚ùå Missing: Explicit "Budget Note" requirement

### New Prompt
- ‚úÖ Focused and concise (~800 words)
- ‚úÖ Clear architecture (3 work types)
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Multiple options feature
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Google Sheets export via `/pushtosheet`
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Budget Note transparency requirement
- ‚ùå Removes too many operational details

### Verdict
**ADOPT THE NEW PROMPT** - but restore key operational sections

---

## 3 KEY ADDITIONS (Game-Changers)

### 1. üéØ Multiple Options Feature
**Current:** Doesn't explicitly handle "Give me Basic, Standard, and Premium"  
**New:** "MUST generate a complete and distinct SOW section for EACH option"

**Impact:** Huge UX improvement. Clients often ask for tiers; this forces structured handling.

```
Example Before: 
‚Üí User asks: "Can you give me Basic and Premium options?"
‚Üí Current: Might combine into one document with vague tiers
‚Üí Result: Confusing pricing table

Example After:
‚Üí User asks: "Can you give me Basic and Premium options?"
‚Üí New: Forces separate SOW for Basic, separate SOW for Premium
‚Üí Result: Crystal clear comparison, separate pricing tables
```

---

### 2. üí∞ Budget Note Requirement
**Current:** Commercial rounding mentioned but not formalized  
**New:** "MUST document these adjustments in a 'Budget Note'"

**Impact:** Transparency. Shows clients exactly why totals were adjusted.

```
Example Budget Note:
"Total adjusted from $47,328 ‚Üí $50,000 by reducing Senior Consultant 
hours from 30 ‚Üí 25 while maintaining deliverable quality. This allows 
for contingency work during implementation."
```

---

### 3. üìä Google Sheets Integration
**Current:** No export mechanism (only editor insertion)  
**New:** `/pushtosheet` command triggers automated Google Sheets export

**Impact:** Automation. SOWs can be automatically archived, shared, tracked.

```
Workflow:
1. Generate SOW in chat
2. User types: /pushtosheet
3. System: Exports to Google Sheets automatically
4. Result: Auto-filed in shared drive for team/client
```

---

## üî¥ What Would Be Lost (Must Restore)

### 1. Detailed SOW Templates
```
Current has:
- Standard Project: 8-phase structure with specific sections
- Audit/Strategy: Strategy + Implementation phases
- Support Retainer: Monthly deliverables + pricing

New has: References templates but doesn't include them
```
**Fix:** Keep current templates in knowledge base section

### 2. Role Allocation Examples (Sam's Law)
```
Current shows:
- Email Template projects: 40-80 hours with role breakdown
- HubSpot Implementation: 120-200 hours with detailed roles
- Retainer: 40 hours/month balanced allocation

New has: Just says "6+ relevant roles"
```
**Fix:** Preserve all examples

### 3. Deliverable Examples
```
Current shows specific tasks for:
- HubSpot: Account Config, Marketing Hub, Service Hub, Reporting
- Email: Design, Development, Testing, Deployment
- Journey Mapping: Discovery, Workshops, Touchpoint Analysis

New has: None
```
**Fix:** Add back examples section

### 4. Explicit Formatting Rules
```
Current specifies:
‚úÖ CORRECT: Bullet lists with + symbol
‚ùå INCORRECT: Paragraph descriptions

New: Assumes AI knows this
```
**Fix:** Keep formatting rules explicit

---

## üí° HYBRID RECOMMENDATION

**Don't replace current with new - MERGE them:**

```
Structure:
1. Keep New Prompt's opening (stronger, cleaner)
2. Add New Prompt's 3 core directives
3. RESTORE all of Current's:
   - Detailed SOW templates
   - Role allocation rules & examples
   - Deliverable examples
   - Formatting rules (bullets vs paragraphs)
4. Add New Prompt's additions:
   - Multiple options instruction
   - Budget Note requirement
   - Google Sheets tool integration
   - Explicit tone guidance
5. Use New Prompt's ending
```

**Result:** ~2,500 word hybrid prompt that:
- ‚úÖ Is cleaner than current (better opening/structure)
- ‚úÖ Adds all new features (multiple options, sheets, budget notes)
- ‚úÖ Keeps all operational detail (templates, examples, rules)
- ‚úÖ Maximum value, minimum confusion

---

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Step 1: Update Prompt (Today)
**File:** `/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` ‚Üí `THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`

**Changes:**
- Replace opening with new opening (cleaner)
- Add new core directives 
- Keep all current templates
- Keep all current examples
- Add new features (multiple options, budget notes, /pushtosheet)
- Use new ending

### Step 2: Test (Before Deploying)
1. Test multi-option brief: "Give me Basic, Standard, Premium tiers"
   - Verify: Produces 3 separate SOW sections
   - Verify: Each has own pricing table
   
2. Test commercial rounding: Brief with inherent total of $47,328
   - Verify: Adjusts to $50,000
   - Verify: Includes "Budget Note" explaining the change

3. Test Google Sheets: Generate SOW, then user types `/pushtosheet`
   - Verify: Command is recognized
   - Verify: SOW exports to Google Sheets

### Step 3: Document (For Team)
- Update training docs with new features
- Document `/pushtosheet` workflow
- Show multiple options examples
- Explain Budget Note format

### Step 4: Deploy
- Update knowledge base
- Restart backend/frontend
- Monitor first 5 SOWs for quality

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Integration

### Files to Update
1. **`/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts`** - Update `THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
2. **`/frontend/lib/gardner-templates.ts`** - May reference prompt (check)
3. **Documentation** - Update any references to prompt structure

### No Code Changes Needed
- ‚úÖ Prompt lives in knowledge base
- ‚úÖ Tool integration (`google-sheets-url-skill`) already exists
- ‚úÖ Chat system already recognizes `/commands`
- ‚úÖ Editor already handles insertion

### Verification After Update
```bash
# 1. Check prompt is updated
grep -n "Multiple Options" /frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts

# 2. Check no compilation errors
npm run build

# 3. Restart frontend
pm2 restart sow-frontend
```

## üìä Success Metrics

After implementation, measure:

| Metric | Target | How to Track |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Multiple Options SOWs** | 100% properly structured | Chat history shows separate sections |
| **Budget Notes** | Every rounding shows note | Check SOW for "Budget Note:" text |
| **Google Sheets Exports** | Zero errors | Monitor command logs |
| **Prompt Quality** | Same or better | Compare SOW feedback scores |

## üéØ Final Answer

### Should We Change the Prompt?
**YES** ‚úÖ

3. **Keeps team's intel** - All proven templates and examples stay
4. **Zero risk** - Hybrid approach has all benefits, minimal downside
5. **Ready to implement** - No code changes needed, just knowledge base update

### When?
**Can be done immediately** - Just a text update to knowledge-base.ts

### Who Tests First?
- [ ] You (generate a multi-option brief to verify)
- [ ] Team (test /pushtosheet command)
- [ ] Client (feedback on quality improvement)

## üöÄ Ready to Proceed?

**Next Actions:**
1. **Confirm decision:** Should I update the prompt now?
2. **If YES:** I'll update `/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` with the hybrid prompt
3. **Then:** Build & restart frontend to activate
4. **Then:** Test multi-option feature with sample brief

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes (update + build + test)
