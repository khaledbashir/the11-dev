# ✅ Clean Editor State - Hardcoded Placeholder Removed

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** Hardcoded placeholder text appeared in editor when creating new workspaces  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

**Before:**
- User creates workspace
- Editor shows a full template with hardcoded sections:
  ```
  Statement of Work (SOW)
  Project Overview
  Scope of Work
  Deliverables
  Timeline
  Budget
  Terms and Conditions
  ```
- This messy UX made it confusing for users

**After:**
- User creates workspace
- Editor shows **completely blank/clean canvas**
- User can start typing immediately
- No template clutter

---

## 🔧 What Changed

### **File:** `frontend/lib/content.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
export const defaultEditorContent = {
  type: "doc",
  content: [
    // ❌ 13 hardcoded sections with full template text
    // "Statement of Work (SOW)", "Project Overview", etc.
  ],
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const defaultEditorContent = {
  type: "doc",
  content: [
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      content: [],  // ✅ Empty paragraph = blank canvas
    },
  ],
};
```

---

## ✅ Result

**User Experience Now:**
```
1. Click "New Workspace" 
   ↓
2. ✅ See blank editor (no placeholder)
3. ✅ See clean chat interface (no initial messages)
4. ✅ Ready to type immediately
5. Type content fresh
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

After restart, verify:
- [ ] Create a new workspace
- [ ] Editor shows **blank canvas** (no sections)
- [ ] Chat is clean (no placeholder messages)
- [ ] Can start typing immediately
- [ ] AI editor still works (slash commands, formatting, etc.)

## 💡 Why This Matters

2. **Flexibility:** Users can structure their SOWs however they want
3. **Professional:** Clean state feels more premium
4. **AI-Friendly:** AI can generate custom structure based on needs
