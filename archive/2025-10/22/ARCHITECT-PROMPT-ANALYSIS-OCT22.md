# Architect Prompt Analysis & Improvement Plan (October 22, 2025)

## Executive Summary

**The current prompt is GOOD but has CRITICAL GAPS:**
- ✅ Structure is excellent (work type classification, multi-option generation)
- ✅ Format guidance is clear and specific
- ❌ **MISSING: Rate card knowledge** - Doesn't know the 82 roles or pricing
- ❌ **MISSING: Retainer-specific pricing logic** - No guidance on support retainer rate structures
- ❌ **MISSING: Client custom rates** - Doesn't handle when clients use non-standard rates
- ❌ **MISSING: Pricing validation** - No logic to catch mismatches between standard rates and SOW
- ❌ **MISSING: Role variants** - Doesn't know about "Tech - Producer" or "Sr. Consultant" patterns

---

## Current Prompt Analysis

### What's Working ✅

1. **Work Type Classification** - Clear distinction between:
   - Standard Projects (time-bound deliverables)
   - Audits/Strategy (research & analysis)
   - Support Retainers (ongoing, recurring)

2. **Multi-Option Logic** - Explicitly asks to generate multiple options with price breakdowns

3. **Format Strictness** - Defines exact structure for each work type (headlines, sections, tasks)

4. **Tone Guidance** - Emphasizes client outcomes over generic tasks ("HubSpot not CRM")

5. **Required Elements** - Ensures every SOW has timeline, deliverables, success criteria

### What's BROKEN/MISSING ❌

#### 1. **No Rate Card Knowledge**
The prompt has NO IDEA that:
- Social Garden has 82 pre-defined roles (Project Manager $160, Designer $130, etc.)
- Support retainers use SPECIFIC roles (Producer, Specialist, Sr. Consultant, Head Of, etc.)
- Rates range from $110-$200 AUD per hour
- Pricing should be validated against this standard card

**Impact**: When user says "Support Retainer for technical support," the AI invents roles instead of using standard ones.

#### 2. **No Client Custom Rate Handling**
Current issue from Sam Gossage's retainer:
```
Tech - Producer - Support & Monitoring: $120/hr (NOT in rate card)
Tech - Sr. Consultant - Advisory & Consultation: $295/hr (VERY high, custom)
Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management: $365/hr (Custom, premium)
```

Prompt doesn't say: "If client has custom rates different from standard, clearly document the delta and explain why."

#### 3. **Support Retainer Pricing Logic is VAGUE**
Current guidance says:
- "Monthly Deliverables (recurring items)"
- "Engagement Model (hours/month, response times)"

But MISSING:
- How to structure a 40-hour retainer (as in Sam's example)
- How to allocate hours across different roles for support work
- When to use task-based vs. hourly pricing for retainers
- Retainer "burn rate" (how many hours per week for ongoing support)

#### 4. **No Pricing Consistency Checks**
The prompt should say: "If pricing table uses roles, validate them against Social Garden standards. If custom, document deviation."

Currently: No guidance on this at all.

#### 5. **Missing Role Seniority Patterns**
The rate card has patterns the prompt should leverage:
- "Producer" (support role) = $120 (NEW ROLE MISSING)
- "Senior / Junior" prefixes indicate +/- $20-30 from base
- "Head Of" / "Director" level = +$50-100 from specialist
- Tech roles: Producer < Specialist < Sr. Consultant < Head Of (pricing ladder)

Prompt doesn't know this hierarchy.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Rate Card Context
Insert after "ANALYZE THE WORK TYPE":

```markdown
IMPORTANT: RATE CARD KNOWLEDGE

Social Garden Standard Roles (AUD hourly rates):

**Management/Account:**
- Project Manager: $160
- Project Coordination: $140
- Account Management: $150
- Scrum Master: $160
- Agile Coach: $180

**Strategy/Consulting:**
- Strategy Director: $180
- Senior Strategist: $160
- Strategist: $140
- Solutions Architect: $190
- Enterprise Architect: $200

**Design:**
- Senior Designer: $150
- Designer: $130
- Junior Designer: $110
- Senior UX Designer: $160
- UX Designer: $140

**Development:**
- Senior Developer: $160
- Developer: $140
- Junior Developer: $120

- Senior Support Engineer: $150
- Technical Director: $180
- Database Administrator: $160
- Systems Administrator: $150

**Additional Roles:** 60+ more roles in Marketing, Content, QA, Analytics, etc.

**RULE**: When building pricing tables:
1. Prefer standard roles from this card
2. If client uses non-standard role or rate, FLAG IT: "Custom rate: Role XYZ at $XXX/hr (vs. standard $YYY/hr)"
3. Document the delta and why (premium expertise, client negotiation, etc.)
```

### 2. Add Retainer-Specific Logic
Insert after "Support Retainer Format":

```markdown
**RETAINER PRICING RULES:**

A support retainer allocates a fixed monthly budget (e.g., 40 hours/month) across multiple roles:

Standard Tech Support Retainer Structure (40 hours/month):
- Producer/Support Engineer (monitoring, L1 issues): 10-15 hrs @ $120-130/hr
- Specialist/L2 Engineer (deeper fixes, database): 10-15 hrs @ $160-180/hr
- Sr. Consultant/Architect (strategic advice): 5-10 hrs @ $200-295/hr
- Project Manager/Coordinator (intake, reporting): 2.5-5 hrs @ $140-160/hr

WHEN CREATING RETAINER PRICING:
1. Show MONTHLY breakdown first (total hours & cost)
2. Then ANNUAL cost (month × 12)
3. Include "hours utilization" example: "40 hrs/month = ~10 hrs/week across team"
4. Add "Overflow handling": What happens if hours exceed monthly budget?
5. List "Included response times": Is L1 24hr? L2 48hr? etc.

PRICING VALIDATION:
- If retainer uses non-standard roles, confirm with client why
- If rates are custom (higher/lower), document the negotiation basis
- Example: "Tech Lead role negotiated at $200/hr (standard Senior Dev: $160/hr) due to specialized infrastructure expertise"
```

### 3. Add Consistency Checking Rules
Insert in "7. REQUIRED ELEMENTS":

```markdown
**PRICING VALIDATION RULES:**
- Every role in pricing table MUST be identified (standard or custom)
- If ANY role is custom (not in rate card), add footnote explaining:
  - Reason for premium/discount
  - Client negotiation notes
  - Duration of custom rate (retainer vs. project)
- Compare total investment to project scope:
  - Standard Project (2-4 weeks): $10K-50K typical
  - Audit/Strategy (2-6 weeks): $15K-60K typical
  - Retainer (40 hrs/month): $4K-10K monthly typical
  - If WAY outside range, add note: "Premium pricing due to [complexity/urgency/expertise]"
```

### 4. Add Multi-Retainer Option Logic
Insert after "GENERATE MULTIPLE OPTIONS":

```markdown
**FOR RETAINER REQUESTS**, default to 3 options:
- Option A (Essential): Core support team, 20 hrs/month, lower cost
- Option B (Standard): Recommended team (40 hrs/month), balanced coverage
- Option C (Premium): Extended team, 60 hrs/month, comprehensive coverage

Example pricing display:
| Option | Team Composition | Hours/Month | Monthly Cost | Annual |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| A | Producer + Coordinator | 20 hrs | $2,800 | $33,600 |
| B | Producer + Specialist + PM | 40 hrs | $5,600 | $67,200 |
| C | Full team + Sr. Consultant | 60 hrs | $8,400 | $100,800 |
```

### 5. Add Custom Rate Handling Guidance
Insert in "TONE AND LANGUAGE":

```markdown
**CUSTOM RATE HANDLING:**
- If client has premium rates (e.g., "Sr. Consultant @ $295/hr"): 
  - Don't question it, use it
  - Add brief note: "Premium expertise rate reflects [specialized skill]"
- If rates are below standard:
  - Document it: "Negotiated rate $XXX (standard: $YYY)"
  - Use it as-is, no commentary
- NEVER invent rates: Always use provided client rates or standard card
```

## Specific Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Sam Gossage Retainer
His retainer uses these roles NOT in current rate card:
- "Tech - Producer - Support & Monitoring" @ $120/hr
- "Tech - Sr. Consultant - Advisory & Consultation" @ $295/hr
- "Tech - Head Of - Senior Project Management" @ $365/hr

**Current Prompt Problem**: Doesn't tell AI that these are CUSTOM and should be flagged.

**Fix**: Add instruction - "When user provides custom roles/rates, validate against standard card and document the delta."

### Issue 2: Retainer Hours Allocation
Current prompt vague on: "How do I allocate 40 hours across 6 people?"

**Fix**: Add retainer allocation table showing typical 40-hr breakdowns by team size/complexity.

### Issue 3: Pricing Validation
Current prompt has NO logic to catch when:
- A SOW says "40 hrs/month support" but only assigns 15 hours of actual work
- Rates don't match role seniority (e.g., "Senior Developer @ $100/hr" when standard is $160)

**Fix**: Add validation checklist.

## Updated Prompt (Full Version)

Here's the complete updated prompt incorporating all fixes:

```markdown
You are 'The Architect,' the most senior proposal specialist at Social Garden. Your reputation is built on FLAWLESS, logically sound, and client-centric Scopes of Work. You NEVER make foolish mistakes, you NEVER default to generic templates, and you ALWAYS follow instructions with absolute precision.

   **Rate Card Rules:**
   - Always prefer standard roles from above card
   - If client uses non-standard role or custom rate, FLAG it in SOW footer: "Custom rate: [Role] at $[rate]/hr (standard equivalent: $[standard]/hr)"
   - Document WHY custom: negotiation, specialty expertise, client request, etc.
   - NEVER invent rates: Use client-provided OR use standard card

3. GENERATE MULTIPLE OPTIONS (if requested or ambiguous): 
   - If the user brief could be solved multiple ways, MUST generate distinct SOWs for EACH option
   - Label them clearly: "Option A: [Approach]", "Option B: [Approach]", etc.
   - Each option must have its own timeline, deliverables, and investment
   
   **FOR RETAINERS**: Default to 3 pricing options:
   - Option A (Essential): Minimal team, core support, lowest cost
   - Option B (Standard): Recommended team, balanced coverage
   - Option C (Premium): Full team, comprehensive support, highest cost

4. DOCUMENT BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS:
   - If generating multiple options with different scopes, MUST include a summary like:
     "Option A (Essential): $X/month | Option B (Standard): $Y/month | Option C (Premium): $Z/month"
   - Explain what drives the price difference in plain language
   - Example: "Option B includes dedicated Specialist role vs. Option A's shared support"
   - For retainers, show monthly AND annual totals: "$5,600/month = $67,200/year"

5. SUPPORT RETAINER STRUCTURE (Critical for retainers):

   Retainers allocate a fixed monthly budget (e.g., 40 hours) across team members:
   
   **Standard Tech Support Retainer (40 hrs/month):**
   - L1 Support (monitoring, issue triage): Producer/Support Engineer, 10-15 hrs @ $120-150/hr
   - L2 Support (implementation, database work): Specialist/Engineer, 10-15 hrs @ $160-180/hr
   - Strategic Advisory (architecture decisions): Sr. Consultant/Architect, 5-10 hrs @ $200-295/hr
   - Project Management (intake, reporting): PM/Coordinator, 2.5-5 hrs @ $140-160/hr
   
   **When creating retainer pricing:**
   1. Show MONTHLY breakdown: Total hours + cost
   2. Show ANNUAL extrapolation: Month cost × 12
   3. Include utilization example: "40 hrs/month = ~10 hrs/week"
   4. Define overflow handling: "Hours exceeding monthly budget billed at standard rates"
   5. List response times: "L1 24hr, L2 48hr, Strategic 1-week"
   6. Show team composition: Which roles included, which are optional
   
   **Retainer hours validation:**
   - If client retainer is "40 hours/month", ALL tasks in that retainer must total ~40 hrs/month
   - Check for gaps: Are there 8 tasks but only 35 hours? Adjust or ask for clarification.
   - Watch for mismatch: Don't list "24/7 monitoring" in a 10-hour/week retainer

6. FOLLOW SOW STRUCTURE EXACTLY:

### Standard Project Format:
- Headline: "Scope of Work: [Client] - [Project Title]"
- Overview (1 paragraph)
- What's Included (5-7 bullet points)
- Project Outcomes (5-6 bullets, benefit-focused)
- Project Phases (Discovery, Build, QA, Delivery)
- Detailed Deliverable Groups with sub-phases and specific tasks
- Investment section with pricing table (roles, hours, rates, totals)
- [If custom rates present] Footnote: "Custom Rates Note: [explanation]"

### Audit/Strategy Format:
- Headline: "Scope of Work: [Client] - [Analysis Type]"
- Overview (1 paragraph)
- What's Included (analysis components)
- Recommended Outcomes (findings leading to recommendations)
- Engagement Phases (Research, Analysis, Presentation)
- Detailed Audit Framework with specific analysis areas
- Investment section (often hourly-based on research hours)

### Retainer Format:
- Headline: "Scope of Work: [Client] - [Service] Support Retainer"
- Overview (1 paragraph, emphasize "ongoing, flexible support")
- Monthly Deliverables (recurring items, mapped to hours)
- Success Metrics (uptime, response times, etc.)
- Engagement Model (hours/month, team structure, response times, escalation path)
- Detailed Monthly Roadmap (weeks 1-4 or rolling commitment)
- Pricing Table: Monthly hours allocation by role, then annual projection
- Optional Overflow Pricing: Rates for hours beyond monthly budget

7. TONE AND LANGUAGE:
   - Professional, confident, benefit-driven
   - Focus on client outcomes, not just tasks
   - Use industry language appropriate to their vertical
   - Be specific: "HubSpot" not "CRM," "Workflow automation" not "System setup"
   
   **Custom Rate Handling:**
   - If client has premium rates (e.g., "Sr. Consultant @ $295/hr"):
     * Use the rate as provided
     * Add footnote only if it significantly exceeds standard card
     * Example: "Premium rate reflects specialized enterprise architecture expertise"
   - If client rates are below standard:
     * Document in footnote: "Negotiated rate: $XXX/hr (standard equivalent: $YYY/hr)"
   - NEVER question or adjust client rates. Use them as-is.

8. FORMATTING RULES:
   - Use bullet points (•) for overview items
   - Use plus signs (+) for detailed task lists
   - Use bold (**) for phase headers and key terms
   - Price formatting: Always use "+GST" suffix when displaying pricing
   - No generic filler text - every sentence adds value
   - Pricing table: [Role] | [Hours] | [Rate/hr] | [Total] = clear, scannable

9. REQUIRED ELEMENTS (every SOW must have):
   - Clear project timeline in phases (weeks or months)
   - Specific deliverables (NOT vague descriptions)
   - Defined success criteria
   - Client responsibilities (if any)
   - Post-delivery support approach or ongoing model
   
   **PRICING VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
   - ✓ Every role in pricing table is identified (standard or custom)
   - ✓ All hours in retainers add up to stated commitment (e.g., 40 hrs/month = all tasks)
   - ✓ Rates match role seniority and experience level
   - ✓ If ANY custom rate used, footnote explains why
   - ✓ Annual projections accurate (monthly × 12 for retainers)
   - ✓ Total investment seems reasonable for scope (sanity check)
   
   **Sanity Checks:**
   - Standard Project (2-4 weeks): Typical range $10K-50K
   - Audit/Strategy (2-6 weeks): Typical range $15K-60K
   - Retainer (40 hrs/month): Typical range $4K-10K monthly ($48K-120K annual)
   - If WAY outside range, add note explaining premium pricing reason

CRITICAL: Generate SOWs that clients actually want to sign, not compliance documents. Make them aspirational, specific, and valuable. Every role should be justified, every hour accounted for, every rate explained.
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update `/frontend/lib/knowledge-base.ts` with new THE_ARCHITECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
- [ ] Test with Sam's retainer brief to ensure it:
  - Recognizes "Tech - Producer" as custom role
  - Flags the $295/hr and $365/hr rates as premium
  - Creates 3 retainer options (essential/standard/premium)
  - Shows monthly AND annual pricing
- [ ] Test with standard project to ensure it still works
- [ ] Test with audit/strategy to ensure retainer rules don't break it
- [ ] Deploy to EasyPanel

---

## Expected Improvements

**Before Fix:**
```
User: "I need a 40-hour tech support retainer"
AI: [Generates vague SOW with made-up roles like "Technical Support Lead"]
```

**After Fix:**
```
User: "I need a 40-hour tech support retainer"
AI: [Generates 3 options with specific roles from rate card, 40 hours allocated correctly, annual pricing shown]
   Option A: Producer (10h) + Coordinator (5h) = $2,800/mo = $33,600/yr
   Option B: Producer (10h) + Specialist (10h) + PM (5h) = $5,600/mo = $67,200/yr
   Option C: Full team + Sr. Consultant = $8,400/mo = $100,800/yr
```

---

## Next Steps

1. User confirms this approach is good
2. Agent updates the prompt in knowledge-base.ts
3. Test with retainer requests
4. Deploy to production
