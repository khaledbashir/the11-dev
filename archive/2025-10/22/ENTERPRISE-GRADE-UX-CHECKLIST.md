## ✅ FEATURES TO TEST

### 1. 🚪 Dashboard Entry Point (CRITICAL FIX)
**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS TEST  
**What it is:** App loads directly on dashboard. No auto-navigation away.  
**How to test:**
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] See dashboard load with all workspaces/SOWs visible
- [ ] Dashboard stays visible (doesn't auto-switch to editor)
- [ ] Manually click a SOW to enter editor view

**Expected console logs:**
```
📋 Available workspaces for dashboard chat: Array(8)
✅ Loaded 8 Gardners: Array(8)
🎯 [Agent Selection] Default agent set to: gen-the-architect
Total workspaces loaded: 7
Total SOWs loaded: 10
```

**Pass Criteria:** Dashboard visible, no auto-navigation ✅

---

### 2. 🧵 Auto-Create Missing Threads (CRITICAL FIX)
**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS TEST  
**What it is:** If a thread doesn't exist (400 error), app creates it automatically.  
**How to test:**
- [ ] Click on any SOW to open it
- [ ] Watch browser console during load
- [ ] Look for one of these two patterns:

**Pattern A: Thread exists (happy path)**
```
🧵 [getThreadChats] Fetching messages from gen-the-architect/sow-xyz
✅ [getThreadChats] Got 0 messages from thread (attempt 1/5)
ℹ️ No chat history found for this SOW
```

**Pattern B: Thread doesn't exist (auto-create)**
```
🧵 [getThreadChats] Fetching messages from gen-the-architect/sow-xyz
⚠️ [getThreadChats] Thread doesn't exist (400). Creating thread now...
✅ [getThreadChats] Thread created on-demand: sow-xyz-new
```

**Pass Criteria:** No "❌ [getThreadChats] Failed (attempt 5/5): 400" errors ✅

---

### 3. 🤖 Auto-Agent Selection (WORKING)
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY WORKING  
**Evidence:** Your console shows: `🤖 [Auto-Select] Editor mode → Auto-selecting GEN - The Architect`

**How it works:**
- Dashboard view → "Business Analyst" agent selected
- Editor view → "The Architect" agent selected

**Pass Criteria:** Correct agent auto-selected based on view ✅

---

### 4. ⏳ Workspace Creation Progress Modal (NEEDS TEST)
**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS TEST  
**What it is:** 4-step progress modal with animations when creating new workspace.

**How to test:**
- [ ] Go to dashboard
- [ ] Click "Create New Workspace" button
- [ ] Observe progress modal
- [ ] Should show:
  1. ✓ Workspace data saved
  2. ✓ AnythingLLM workspace created
  3. ✓ Master dashboard initialized
  4. ✓ Workspace ready!

**Expected:** Smooth animations, clear progress tracking  
**Pass Criteria:** See 4-step progress modal with checkmarks ✅

---

### 5. 🌱 Beautiful Onboarding Flow (NEEDS TEST)
**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS TEST  
**What it is:** 5-step guided experience for first-time users.

**How to test:**
- [ ] Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Should show 5-step onboarding flow
- [ ] Steps:
  1. Welcome screen
  2. Create first workspace
  3. Navigate to dashboard
  4. Create first SOW
  5. Start editing

**Expected:** Gradient UI, smooth progress, helpful text  
**Pass Criteria:** Can complete all 5 steps, then normal app loads ✅

---

### 6. 💬 Chat Works Without Errors
**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS TEST  
**What it is:** Open any SOW and type a message. Chat should work.

**How to test:**
- [ ] Open a SOW
- [ ] Type a message in the chat box
- [ ] Press send
- [ ] Message should appear
- [ ] AI response should arrive (2-5 seconds)

**Expected console logs:**
```
🧵 [getThreadChats] Fetching messages from gen-the-architect/sow-xyz
✅ [getThreadChats] Got 0 messages from thread (attempt 1/5)
```

**Pass Criteria:** Chat sends, receives response, no 400 errors ✅

## 🔧 Debugging Help

**Q: I see dashboard then it switches to editor**  
A: This shouldn't happen anymore. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) and check console.

**Q: Chat shows "No chat history found"**  
A: That's OK for new SOWs. Try sending a message - chat should work.

**Q: I see 400 errors in console**  
A: Check if it says "Creating thread on-demand". If so, wait 5 seconds and refresh. Thread should work after.

**Q: Workspace creation modal doesn't show**  
A: This only shows for NEW workspaces. Try creating one while watching console.
