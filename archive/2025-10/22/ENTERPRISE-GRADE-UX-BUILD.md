# 🚀 Enterprise-Grade UX Build

**Branch**: `enterprise-grade-ux`
**Status**: 🔨 In Progress
**Target**: Transform from "kiddish" to "enterprise professional"

## 📋 Build Plan

### Phase 1: Auto-Agent Selection ✅ (THIS PHASE - 2-3 hours)
**Objective**: Eliminate manual agent selection - automatically select the right agent based on context

**Changes**:
1. `frontend/components/tailwind/agent-sidebar-clean.tsx`
   - Add `viewMode` prop detection
   - Auto-select agent based on mode (Dashboard → Business Analyst, Editor → Architect)
   - Show context hint: "Selected for dashboard intelligence"

2. `frontend/app/page.tsx`
   - Pass `viewMode` to agent sidebar component
   - Log which agent was auto-selected and why

**Expected Outcome**: 
- User opens dashboard → sees "Business Analyst" ready
- User opens editor → sees "The Architect" ready
- No manual dropdown clicking needed

**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Immediate UX improvement)

### Phase 2: Beautiful Onboarding Flow (4-6 hours)
**Objective**: New users see a guided 5-step setup flow

**Changes**:
1. Create `frontend/components/tailwind/onboarding-flow.tsx`
   - Step 1: Welcome & Features overview
   - Step 2: Create first workspace
   - Step 3: Upload client info (optional)
   - Step 4: Generate first SOW
   - Step 5: Start chat with Architect
   - Progress indicator + animations

2. Modify `frontend/app/page.tsx`
   - Show onboarding when: first visit OR zero workspaces
   - Store "has seen onboarding" flag

**Expected Outcome**:
- New users understand what the app does
- Guided through creating first workspace
- Professional, modern UX

**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Makes app discoverable)

### Phase 3: Workspace Creation Progress UI (3-4 hours)
**Objective**: Show real-time progress during workspace creation

**Changes**:
1. Create `frontend/components/tailwind/workspace-creation-progress.tsx`
   - Show 4 steps with real-time updates:
     - Creating AnythingLLM workspace...
     - Setting AI agent prompt...
     - Embedding knowledge base...
     - Creating first SOW...
   - Checkmark animation as each completes
   - Modal prevents interaction during creation

2. Modify `frontend/app/page.tsx`
   - Emit progress events during `handleCreateWorkspace()`
   - Pass progress state to component

3. Modify `frontend/components/tailwind/sidebar-nav.tsx`
   - Show progress modal during creation
   - Disable "Create" button during process

**Expected Outcome**:
- Users see workspace creation happening step-by-step
- Feels professional and responsive
- No frozen/broken feeling
