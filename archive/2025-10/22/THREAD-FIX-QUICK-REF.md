# ðŸ§µ AnythingLLM Thread Fix - Quick Reference

## **The Problem**
When creating a workspace, users were being asked to "name the thread"  
This is NOT how AnythingLLM works - threads should auto-name from first message

## **The Solution**
âœ… **Default thread now auto-creates** when workspace is created  
âœ… **No naming dialog** appears  
âœ… **Thread auto-renames** when user sends first message  

## **What Changed**
- `frontend/lib/anythingllm.ts`
  - Added automatic default thread creation in `createOrGetClientWorkspace()`
  - Thread names now update automatically from first chat message (AnythingLLM native behavior)

## **How It Works Now**

```
Create Workspace
    â†“
âœ… Default thread opens (no naming)
    â†“
User types: "What's the HubSpot integration cost?"
    â†“
âœ… Thread auto-renames to: "HubSpot Integration Pricing"
```

## **User Experience**
- **Before:** Create workspace â†’ Get naming dialog â†’ Name thread â†’ Chat
- **After:** Create workspace â†’ Start chatting immediately âœ…

## **Frontend Status**
- âœ… Code deployed
- âœ… Frontend restarted
- âœ… Live on http://localhost:3001

## **Testing**
1. Create a new workspace
2. Confirm you see a chat interface (no naming popup)
3. Type a message
4. Watch the thread name update automatically
5. Create another thread - same behavior

**That's it! The weird naming flow is gone. Now it mirrors AnythingLLM behavior perfectly.**
