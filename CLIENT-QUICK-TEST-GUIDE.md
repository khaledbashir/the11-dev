# 🎯 QUICK FIX VERIFICATION GUIDE

**For Client Testing - 2 Minutes**

---

## ✅ FIX #1: Sidebar Delete/Rename Buttons (30 seconds)

**What was wrong:** Long names hid the buttons  
**What's fixed:** Names truncate to 5 chars, buttons always visible

**Test Steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Look at left sidebar
3. Find any workspace or SOW name
4. **CHECK:** Do you see the delete (🗑️) and rename (✏️) buttons?
5. **Expected:** YES - buttons are visible next to every item

**Visual Check:**
```
Before: "ABC Company Marketing Campaign" [buttons hidden]
After:  "ABC C..." [🗑️] [✏️] ← buttons always visible!
```

## ✅ FIX #2: Auto-Detect Client Name (1 minute)

**What was wrong:** Had to manually rename SOWs  
**What's fixed:** AI detects client name and renames automatically

**Test Steps:**
1. Click "New Workspace" button (+ icon in sidebar)
2. Name it anything (e.g., "Test Client")
3. New workspace opens with blank SOW
4. Open AI chat (bottom right)
5. Type: **"Create a HubSpot integration for XYZ Corporation"**
6. **CHECK:** Did you see a green toast saying "🏢 Auto-detected client: XYZ Corporation"?
7. **CHECK:** Did the SOW title change to "SOW - XYZ Corporation"?
8. **Expected:** YES to both

**Visual Check:**
```
You type: "Create SOW for Acme Inc"
         ↓
Toast appears: "🏢 Auto-detected client: Acme Inc"
         ↓
SOW renamed: "SOW - Acme Inc"
```

## ✅ FIX #3: Pricing Tables in Editor (30 seconds)

**What was wrong:** Pricing tables not appearing when inserting AI content  
**What's fixed:** Tables insert correctly and are editable

**Test Steps:**
1. Continue from Fix #2 test above
2. Wait for AI to generate the SOW (with pricing table)
3. Look for the "📝 Insert to Editor" button in the AI chat
4. Click "Insert to Editor"
5. **CHECK:** Do you see a pricing table in the editor?
6. **CHECK:** Can you click on the table and edit roles/hours/rates?
7. **Expected:** YES - table is there and editable

**Visual Check:**
```
AI generates SOW with pricing table
         ↓
Click "Insert to Editor"
         ↓
Table appears in editor ✅
Table is editable (click to modify) ✅
